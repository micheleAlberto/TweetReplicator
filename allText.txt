Obamacare Enrollment Is Outpacing Last Year With 8 Million Sign-Ups
WASHINGTON -- More than 8 million people signed up for coverage via the federal HealthCare.gov health insurance exchange marketplace as of Saturday, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Tuesday.
On Friday, President Barack Obama announced that enrollment had reached 6 million after this month's deadline for policies that will be in force on New Year's Day. Burwell's revised tally, delivered during a conference call with enrollment workers, includes millions of people whose current plans have been automatically renewed. The final deadline for obtaining 2016 coverage is Jan. 31.
The Department of Health and Human Services predicted modest growth in the health insurance exchanges during this, the third Obamacare open enrollment campaign, but appear to be on track with or even surpassing their own internal projections of 10 million exchange customers in 2016. According to figures from Burwell and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, sign-ups are outpacing 2015's so far, and more young people are participating.
"Today, we have more sign-ups, more new enrollees and a younger population than we did last year," Burwell said on the conference call.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services disclosed almost 8.3 million enrollments via the HealthCare.gov system serving more than 30 states, 29 percent of which are new to the exchanges. This total doesn't include sign-ups in states with their own exchanges, such asCalifornia and New York, some of which are still accepting enrollments for January coverage.
"Millions more have been signed up or been re-enrolled in state-based marketplaces in addition to that," Burwell said.
A National Monument for Womens Equality  The White House
May it stand for years and years to come, telling of the work that the women of the United States have accomplished; the example we have given foreign nations; and our determination that they shall beas ourselvesfree citizens, recognized as the equals of men.
Alva Belmont, January 4,1931 Today, on Equal Pay Day, President Obama will designate a national monument in honor of the movement for womens equality. The new Belmont-Paul Womens Equality National Monument will protect the iconic house, which served as the National Womans Party headquarters, but it will also serve to elevate and amplify the stories, memories, and accomplishments of the many women who passed through its hallseach profoundly dedicated to securing womens suffrage and equal rights in the United States.
Named for activist and suffragist Alva Belmont, former president of the National Womens Party, and Alice Paul, the Partys founder and chief strategist, the monument was originally acquired in 1929and quickly became a vital organ in the movement for womens equality. Women filled its rooms daily, working tirelessly to draft petitions, organize protests, write letters, and provide each other with both the physical and emotional support necessary to sustain each others intense commitment. Leading these advocacy efforts was Alice Paul, who drafted an updated Equal Rights Amendment text, wrote provisions that were later included in the Civil Rights Act to prevent discrimination on the basis of gender, and worked to get womens equality language incorporated in the U.N. Charter. It is incredible to me that any woman should consider the fight for full equality won. It has just begun. There is hardly a field, economic or political, in which the natural and unaccustomed policy is not to ignore womenUnless women are prepared to fight politically they must be content to be ignored politically.Alice Paul,1920 The womens companionship in their efforts extended long beyond the work day, though. At night, the house transformed into a hotel and second home for many of its memberssome slept over only on occasion, but others stayed for nearly their entire lives. (Alice Paul could still be found there, greeting visitors, clear into her 80s.) Many came to think of themselves as family.
Today, the National Womans Party serves as an educational organization, seeking to educate the public about both the history of the monumentand the ongoing womens rights equality movement. In that way, it has played an essential and enduring role in helping the public to follow in the footsteps of women like Alice Paul and Alva Belmont. Thats just one of the reasons its designation as a national monument is so significant. When I got to the house the first time and began to understand the decades long body of work and magnitude of what these people had achieved, I was blown away. The rooms are filled with story after story of events that were incredibly significant in American history.Megan Smith, White House Chief Technology Officer Todays designation will also permanently protect one of the oldest standing houses near the U.S. Capitol and help preserve an extensive archival collection that documents the history, strategies, tactics, and accomplishments of the movement to secure womens suffrage and equal rights in the United States and around the globe.
Efforts to protect this site date back to the early 1970s, and more recent proposals to include the site in the National Park System have garnered Congressional supportincluding bipartisan legislation introduced by Senator Mikulskias well as strong support from local elected officials, community leaders, womens organizations, conservation groups and historians. In addition to protecting more land and water than any President in historymore than 265 million acresPresident Obama has sought to protect places that are diverse, culturally and historically significant, and that reflect the story of all Americans. By honoring the history and accomplishments of the movement for womens equality, todays designation will build on this effort towards a more inclusive National Park System and tell the story of womens fight for equality for generations to come. Our national parks and other protected sites that represent Americas diverse history and culture and will continue to be an important priority for the Administration as the country celebrates the National Park Service Centennial this year.
The National Womans Party purchased the house in 1929, making the building its national headquarters. Today, visitors of the Sewall-Belmont House can learn about the women who dedicated their lives to the struggle for womens rights.Congresswoman RosaDeLauro The designation of the Sewall-Belmont House as a national historical site ensures that its legacy will endure for generations to come. The accomplishments and history that the Belmont-Paul Womens Equality Monument represent resonate deeply during a time when national conversation is focused more than ever on equal rights. And while todays generation of women have continued to forge ahead, standing on the hard-won accomplishments of the generations before them, theres still more to be done. Todays designation of the Belmont-Paul Womens Equality National Monument is an important step in solidifying the legacy of the equal rights movement, buteven more importantlyits a way for us to look forward, into a more equal future for all.

We've made huge progress in the fight to #ActOnClimate, but we're not done yet. Say you agree: http://ofa.bo/a5VY
The U.S. Can Lead the World to a Climate Agreement
In two weeks officials from nearly every country on Earth will gather at the 21st Conference of the Parties in Paris. This is the latest gathering of nations, convened by the U.N., to discuss and potentially agree on a global strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting our planet.
To date, the international community hasnt been able to act together with the kind of commitment, urgency and ambition thats needed to confront the climate challenge.
But this time is different.
Countries around the world are closer than ever to consensus on the imperative to act globally. The convergence of attitudes has come by necessity. For all of us, climate change is no longer just an environmental problemits a pressing matter of public health, safety, economics and national security.
In the U.S. rising temperatures are bringing more smog, more asthma and longer allergy seasonsthreatening our kids health. Extreme storms, fires and floods are putting our farms, businesses and coastlines at risk. In low-lying Bangladesh and the Pacific Islands citizens are retreating from sea level rise. In parts of Africa blistering drought threatens the food supply. Summer sea ice in the Arctic is receding to unprecedented levels.
These impacts can add up to instability over basic resources like food and water, along with very real security threats that cant be ignored. The world is coming to grips with the reality we face and the consequences of inaction. That evolution will be evident in Paris.
At the same time, since prior COP meetings, weve strengthened our scientific understanding of the climate problem even further and designed newer and better technological solutions. Around the world were seeing major progress on low-carbon electricity-generation technologies, including renewable energy sources, energy-efficient products and carbon-capture-and-storage techniques.
Here in the U.S. private-sector investors have already committed billions of dollars to scale up clean energy innovation. Every major U.S. automaker now offers electric vehicles. And the average cost of utility-scale solar electric systems has dropped 50 percent since 2010. These are clear signals about where our markets are heading. Clean energy innovation is already being rewarded. And other nations see that. This, too, will be reflected in Paris.
Through our laws and policies the U.S. has shown the world that it is possible to act on climate in ways that protect our citizens health and grow the economy at the same time. Weve set historic fuel economy standards that will send our cars twice as far on a gallon of gasoline by the middle of the next decadesaving American families money at the pump and revitalizing our auto industry. Weve made investments to cut energy waste in homes, buildings and appliancessteps that will save American consumers billions of dollars.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys Clean Power Plan has set the U.S. on course to slash carbon pollution from our power sector. This historic step is projected to drive up to $45 billion a year in net climate and health benefits in 2030including reduced health care costs for some of Americas most vulnerable people. Benefits will include thousands fewer premature deaths and trips to the hospital, tens of thousands of avoided asthma attacks and hundreds of thousands fewer missed school days and missed workdays. In the same year American families will see about $85 in annual savings on their utility bills as a result of greater energy efficiencies, driven by the plan.
Under Pres. Barack Obamas leadership, the U.S. has already cut total carbon pollution more than any other nation. And in March we submitted an ambitious target to the U.N. to reduce economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions 26 to 28 percent by 2025. Our strong domestic actions have shown other countries that we are committed to this fight.
Were not acting alone. Some 150 countries representing more than 85 percent of global carbon emissionsincluding economies large and smallhave submitted long-term pledges. And earlier this month in Dubai leaders from around the world agreed on a 2016 road map to negotiate a phase down of climate-damaging hydrofluorocarbons in an achievable time frame.
In Dubai and elsewhere the U.S. is showing an unprecedented commitment to an agreement. As a global community, were in a stronger position than weve ever been heading into international climate talks. Thats whats different.
Countries are acting with a level of urgency and ambition weve never seen. Science has given us even greater clarity about how and why Earths climate is changing. Technology is empowering us to turn the problem into an economic opportunity. America is leading by example. And many other nations are stepping up as well.
Together, weve built the foundation for success in Paris. We have the collective will, tools and proved strategies to get the job done. Im confident that, this time, countries will reach an ambitious global agreement to protect our common home.
Gina McCarthy is administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. During her 30-year career she has worked at the state and local levels on policies related to economic growth, energy, transportation, health, climate and the environment.

Record Warmth `Almost Certainly' Due to Humans, Scientists Say
The odds are vanishingly small that recent years of record warmth arent due to human emissions of greenhouse gases, researchers in the U.S. and Germany said, adding to pressure on world governments to cut back on fossil fuel use.
Thirteen of the 15 warmest years ever recorded were registered through 2014, the researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, or PIK, said Monday in the journal Nature. The odds of that occurring naturally range from one in 5,000 to one in 170,000, they wrote. Data showing 2015 is the warmest year ever were published after their study was completed, and would make the odds even slimmer, PIK said in an e-mailed statement.
"2015 is again the warmest year on record, and this can hardly be by chance, Stefan Rahmstorf, a co-author of the paper, said in the statement. Natural climate variations just cant explain the observed recent global heat records, but man-made global warming can.
Scientists are increasingly attributing individual weather events to climate change, having previously been reluctant to do so, signaling only the trend of rising temperatures as evidence of human influence in the climate.
Envoys from 195 nations agreed in December in Paris to a new deal binding all countries for the first time to cut or limit greenhouse gases. That followed mounting evidence that runaway emissions threaten to make some parts of the world uninhabitable, submerging islands, prolonging droughts and intensifying storms.
Researchers at the University of Oxford and the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute saying earlier this month that global warming doubled the chances of Decembers record U.K. rains occurring. Scientists have also said climate change played a hand in the Californian drought and has lengthened the Australian bush fire season.
The scientists in the latest study performed a statistical analysis combining observed data and computer simulations of the climate to calculate their odds.
Natural climate variability causes temperatures to wax and wane over a period of several years, rather than varying erratically from one year to the next, Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Penn State University said in the statement.
That makes it more challenging to accurately assess the chance likelihood of temperature records. Given the recent press interest, it just seemed like it was important to do this right, and address, in a defensible way, the interesting and worthwhile question of how unlikely it is that the recent run of record temperatures might have arisen by chance alone.

Hot streak continues for American job market
As for the revisions: Januarys job totals were revised down a little, from 172,000 to 168,000, while Februarys totals were also revised up a little, from 242,000 to 245,000. Combined, thats not much of a change.
Regardless, this is another encouraging jobs report  including a heartening bump in average hourly earnings  that reinforces the belief that the U.S. labor market is resilient and healthy. Indeed, the overall labor force has grown by over 1.9 million workers since November  more Americans are entering the job market  which is the strongest totals weve seen in 16 years.
Over the last 12 months, the overall economy has created 2.8 million new jobs, which is a strong number. Whats more, March was the 66th consecutive month of positive job growth  the best stretch since 1939  and the 73rd consecutive month in which weve seen private-sector job growth, which is the longest on record.

ISIL STRATEGY
Our nation has been at war with terrorists since al Qaeda killed nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001. We answered that tragic attack by hardening our defenses and critical infrastructure, disrupting countless plots and pursuing terrorist networks overseas, disrupting safe havens in different countries, and decimating al Qaeda's leadership, including the operation that killed Osama bin Laden.
But over the last few years, the terrorist threat has evolved. Even as we've become better at preventing complex, multifaceted attacks like 9/11, terrorists are turning to less complicated acts of violence, like homemade explosive devices or mass shootings. As the chaos in the region disrupts societies, and as the Internet erases the distance between countries, today we are seeing terrorists try to extend their ideological reach into American communities and poison the minds of people like the Boston Marathon bombers or the San Bernardino killers.
The terrorist group known as ISIL was formerly al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq. In the summer of 2014, ISIL had surged into Iraq, directly threatening Baghdad and Erbil, including locations where U.S. personnel were located, and perpetrating horrific atrocities, beheadings, crucifixions, and immolations.
Though it calls itself the "Islamic State," it is neither Islamic nor a state. It is a terrorist organization that has perverted a religion into a dangerous ideology. ISIL terrorists have committed countless barbaric atrocities. ISIL's strategy relies on us giving into fear, abandoning our values, and allowing ourselves to be drawn into a long and costly ground war. They know if we occupy foreign lands, they can maintain insurgencies for years that will claim the lives of thousands of our troops, drain our resources, and give them leverage to draw new recruits.
A successful strategy to counter ISIL and the terrorist threat must reflect an understanding of how ISIL functions and the most effective means to dismantle and destroy their operation.

BREAKING: Pres. Obama Just Made History
President Barack Obama wants to give prisoners second chances, and because he has executive powers, he's making that happen for a record number of people.
By the end of March, Obama had already granted clemency during his administration to more prisoners than the last six presidents combined. Today, he announced he is extending that record breaking number by granting another 58 inmates clemency, bringing his total number of commutations to 306.
But Obama's not not done yet, according to White House Counsel Neil Eggleston. In an exclusive interview, he told ATTN: that he's worked closely with Obama on his clemency initiative.
"We've got a lot of months left and I think you're going to see that we'll continue to do this," he said.
The 306 commutations that Obama has given under his administration are not just about the individuals, but about addressing a larger issue. Obama has given commutations as a way to stand up to harsh, often mandatory sentencing laws as part of a push for criminal justice reform. U.S. state and federal prisons held an estimated 1,561,500 inmates at the end of 2014 according to the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics' most recent data released in 2015. The U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world.
"I think he regards this power that he has under the constitution as an important component, but he also believes that to have really lasting relief and prospective relief  because people are still getting sentenced in some cases in excess of mandatory minimums  that criminal justice reform is very important to really do a complete job."
In a statement released announcing the commutations, Obama called on Congress to create a bi-partisan solution to address mass incarceration.
Many of the prisoners on this list were incarcerated for federal drug offenses, similar to Obama's previous rounds of commutations, and were sentenced at a time when the "War On Drugs" and other punishment-focused crime policies led to much harsher prison sentences.
"A lot of these are drug crimes where, particularly 10 or 20 years ago, the sentences were pretty excessive," Eggleston told ATTN:.
President Obama also mentioned the power of clemency to right the wrongs of harsh drug punishments. He met a group of inmates who received clemency from former Presidents Clinton and Bush.
Eggleston said sentencing is one of the most important criteria when he and Obama look over the cases. The president himself makes the final decision.
"So particularly with clemency initiative cases, what we're looking for are instances where an inmate has spent a significant period of time and more time than he or she would spend if they were sentenced today," he said. "In some ways that's the principle thing we're looking at; the sentences from 10, 15, 20 years ago were much longer than they are today." They also look at a long span of prison behavior  since most of the people receiving clemency have been in prison for at least 10 years  including interest in prison educational courses.
However physical freedom from prison is only just the beginning for these inmates. Being convicted of a federal crime can follow a felon for years after release. ATTN: has reported on the difficulty felons have in finding a place to live and getting a job with a conviction on their record. To help with that struggle, Eggleston said the Obama administration has instructed federal employees to "ban the box," an initiative that would require employers to wait until later in the interview process to ask applicants about their criminal history.
"There's a lot of studies that those who were prior incarcerated can get hired if they can get through the initial screening process." he said. "Then they have a chance to show who they are and their character and their dedication."
In his letters to freed prisoners in 2015, Obama underlined his belief in the power of clemency to give second chances.

Weekly Address: We Will Not Be Terrorized
Iran Deal
Building a nuclear bomb requires either uranium or plutonium, but thanks to this deal, Irans four possible ways to leverage those fissile materials are blocked.
Currently, Iran has a uranium stockpile to create 8 to ten nuclear bombs. But thanks to this nuclear deal, Iran must reduce its stockpile of uranium by 98%, and will keep its level of uranium enrichment at 3.67%  significantly below the enrichment level needed to create a bomb.
Let's look into Uranium: Iran would need two key elements to construct a uranium bomb: enough highly enriched uranium to produce enough material to construct a uranium bomb and tens of thousands of centrifuges.
Iran also needs tens of thousands of centrifuges to create highly enriched uranium for a bomb. Right now, Iran has nearly 20,000 centrifuges between their Natanz and Fordow uranium enrichment facilities. But under this deal, Iran must reduce its centrifuges to 6,104 for the next ten years. No enrichment will be allowed at the Fordow facility at all, and the only centrifuges Iran will be allowed to use are their oldest and least efficient models.
In short, heres the difference this historic deal will make:
Let's look into Plutonium:
The third way Iran could build a nuclear weapon is by using weapons-grade plutonium. The only site where Iran could accomplish this is the Arak reactor, a heavy-water nuclear reactor. Right now, this reactor could be used in a weapons program, but under this deal, the Arak reactor will be redesigned so it cannot produce any weapons-grade plutonium. And all the spent fuel rods (which could also be source material for weapons-grade plutonium) will be sent out of the country as long as this reactor exists. Whats more, Iran will not be able to build a single heavy-water reactor for at least 15 years. That means, because of this deal, Iran will no longer have a source for weapons-grade plutonium.
Could there be a covert pathway to Iran building a secret nuclear program?
The previous three pathways occur at facilities that Iran has declared, but what if they try to build a nuclear program in secret? Thats why this deal is so important. Under the new nuclear deal, Iran has committed to extraordinary and robust monitoring, verification, and inspection. International inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will not only be continuously monitoring every element of Irans declared nuclear program, but they will also be verifying that no fissile material is covertly carted off to a secret location to build a bomb. And if IAEA inspectors become aware of a suspicious location, Iran has agreed to implement the Additional Protocol to their IAEA Safeguards Agreement, which will allow inspectors to access and inspect any site they deem suspicious. Such suspicions can be triggered by holes in the ground that could be uranium mines, intelligence reports, unexplained purchases, or isotope alarms.
Basically, from the minute materials that could be used for a weapon comes out of the ground to the minute it is shipped out of the country, the IAEA will have eyes on it and anywhere Iran could try and take it:

The Labor Department is pushing states to create their own paid family leave programs
In California, the first state to guaranteepaid family leave for all workers since 2004,payrolldeductions funda state-runinsurance pool that allows employees totake off up to six weeks at partial income. Working parentsin New Jersey and Rhode Islandreceive comparablebenefits. New York, meanwhile, recently passed similar laws that ensurecompensation doesn't disappear when employees pause workto care for a new child or sick relative.
The publicprograms provide pay for workers whose employers don't offerthe benefit and the federal government wants to see these local efforts spread.
The U.S. LaborDepartment announced Tuesday that it will grant $1.1 million tosix states and municipalities that want to start their own paid family leave programs.The recipients  Denver; Franklin, Ohio; Madison, Wis.; and Hawaii, Indiana and Pennsylvania  will use the money toresearch how much it would costto openthe public aid toits residents, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said.
Our nation has increasingly recognized we are far behind the world on this critical issue, hesaid. We live in a modern family world, and we need to stop living by Leave It To Beaver rules.
The United States guarantees just 12 weeks of job-protected time off to new parents none of which is paid. The issueis also fiercely divisive: TheDemocratic Party platform saysall workers should be paid for those 12 weeks leave, while the Republican Party platform makes no mention of a paidleave policy. Republican leadershave argued suchrules would damage business and discourage employers from hiring young women.
Some oppose local mandates, too. Rhode Island state Rep. Brian Newberry (R)told CBS News last year the publicly funded paid leave programeffectively imposes a tax on many people who wouldnever benefit fromit. The insurance, he said, should be private.
As American women surged into the workforce  female breadwinners now support about 40 percent of households  companies started adding paid leaveas a way to attract and retain talent. Fifty-eight percent of large U.S.firms offer some paid maternity leave, a 2014 Labor Departmentstudy found.But only 12 percent of all private sector workers receive paid family leave to care for a newborn or ailing relative, government data shows.
[San Francisco first U.S. city to require businesses to offer new parents paid leave]
Thus far, only three states California, New Jersey and Rhode Islandguarantee paid family leave for all workers. Eachcovers at least four weeks, paying at least 55 percent of employees' fullincome,financed throughemployee-funded temporary disability insurance programs. New York passed a measure to add the benefit earlier this year, which goes into effect in 2018.
San Francisco took a different approach in April, becoming the first city in the country to require businesses to fund their employees' leave.As for federal workers, President Obama signed an executive order last year allowing federal workers to take off up to six weeks of paid leave.
The new Labor Department grantsare the latest installment of the Paid Leave Analysis Grant Program that has allocated more than $3 million to 17 states and municipalities over the past two years to support research on how to create local paid leave programs that fit a particular area's needs.
The Hawaii Department of Human Services will collect $240,000 to study how the state could adopt a program similar to those in California, New Jersey and Rhode Island.Pennsylvanias Department of Labor and Industry, for example, will receive a $250,000 federal grant to run a cost-benefit analysis for various homegrown paid family-leave models, according to Philly.com.
Rhode Island state Sen. Gayle Goldin (D), who sponsored the states paid family leave billand advocates for the launchof such policies elsewhere, said the funds will help start conversations about the best ways to shape paid family leave in a particular community.Rhode Island, like California and New Jersey, built its program into the states temporary disability insurance, an employee-funded pool of money available to workers since 1942. In 2013, the state changed the law to allow new parents to tap into the money for four weeks of post-birth caregiving.
Weve seen far better health outcomes, she said, and a decrease in stress.

Eight isn't enough
When the vacancy on the Supreme Court opened earlier this year, the court was left with only eight justiceswhich means their rulings on some disputed cases can be handed down as a tie.Most legal cases can be resolved without calling on the Supreme Court, so every case the justices hear has the potential to set an important precedent. The final ruling not only settles the issue for the parties to the case, but can guide lawyers and judges facing related disputes for years to come. Tied rulings set no precedent and offer no new guidance for future cases. This type of obstruction leaves our country's most important judicial body disabled for the rest of the year.A few weeks ago, that happened for the first timeand last week, the Supreme Court deadlocked again on a case that threatened to cripple public unions.From the day the vacancy opened, many Republican senators, led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have promised to stand in the way of any nominee that President Obama offered, no matter his or her qualifications. Now, President Obama has done his job by nominating the highly qualified (and broadly respected) Judge Merrick Garlandbut they still refuse to do theirs.This is truly unprecedented: In recent history, the Senate has never refused to schedule hearings on a Supreme Court nominee. Editorial boards across the country have praised Judge Garland as an exceptional consensus choice, and 76 senatorsincluding six sitting senators who now refuse to give him a hearingvoted to confirm him for the federal court of appeals for the D.C. Circuit in 1997.If senators take issue with Judge Garland's qualifications, they can defend their opposition at hearings and act on it when the Senate votes on his confirmation. But they need to have a hearing and an up-or-down vote.An overwhelming majority of Americans want a fair process. Add your name to say that you've had enough of the partisan political games with our Supreme Court.

Wind Power Continues Steady Growth Across The U.S.
Wind Power Continues Steady Growth Across The U.S.
The U.S. wind power industry is celebrating after reaching a new milestone in November: 70 gigawatts (GW) of generating capacity.
"That's enough to power about 19 million homes," says Michael Goggin, senior director of research at the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA).
There are more than 50,000 wind turbines operating across 40 states and Puerto Rico, according to the AWEA.
Wind power has grown quickly in recent years. It sprinted past the 50 GW and 60 GW milestones in 2012. Growth temporarily stalled as members of Congress let a federal tax credit expire. But now the boom times are back.
The federal budget deal, passed by Congress and signed by President Obama last week, includes a five-year extension of the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit. That sent solar and wind company stocks soaring.
As a low-carbon source of electricity, wind power also got a boost from the Paris climate change agreement and the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan.
There's plenty of room to grow, too. The bulk of the nation's electricity still comes from traditional fuels: coal, natural gas and nuclear. Wind accounts for just a fraction of total generation.
"We're approaching 4.5 to 5 percent of total electricity use in the United States," says Goggin. In 2007  just eight years ago  that figure was less than 1 percent.
One reason wind is becoming more competitive is price. "The cost of wind energy is down by 66 percent  or two-thirds  since 2009," says Goggin, who credits new technology and economies of scale as the industry gets bigger.
Goggin says the wind industry is on-track to meet a plan laid out by the U.S. Department of Energy to generate a fifth of the country's electricity by 2030.

On the Presidents Final State of the Union: Lets Own the FinishLine.
Our economy was in crisison the cusp of depression.
Tonight, Ill be sitting behind him as he delivers his final one, knowing that our economy is back.
Its the last time well do this, but were not even close to done working. You should make sure youre watching this speech tonight, and this is the best place to do it.
Seven years later, I couldnt be more optimistic about America. On virtually every measure, we are better positioned to lead the world in the 21st century.
More made-in-the-USA products are in more markets around the world than ever before. Our businesses have been adding hundreds of thousands of jobs each monthfor a record 70 consecutive months. Last year, American automakers sold more cars and trucks than ever before. And millions of Americans know the peace of mind and security of affordable health care.
Its not because of Barack Obama and Joe Biden.
It is, quite simply, because of you. Your hard work. Your grit.
Thats because, when it comes to making sure every single American has access to real opportunity, our work is never done.
Weve got to continue to build the most skilled and best-educated workforce in the world.
Weve got to build the most modern infrastructure in the worldbecause if Americas manufacturers are going to compete on a global scale, theyve got to be able to get their products to market quickly and efficiently.
We can do that and so much more. And were not going to wait for anybody when it comes to taking whatever steps we can to help the middle class and keep our economic resurgence going.
And folks, we have got to keep appealing to our bigger interests and hopesnot our narrow ones and fears, as weve seen too frequently in our politics.
Weve got to stop getting in our own way when it comes to political parties talking past each other. Its the single biggest impediment to our continued progress.
It makes our conduct of foreign policy more difficult. It makes forging consensus and compromise virtually impossible. And it makes it exponentially harder to restore the basic middle-class bargain.
We have to get back to that. And I believe we can.
Im more optimistic about the prospects of America than when I was as a 29-year-old kid first elected to the United States Senate. And Ive never been more proud to stand up there with our president and with all of you.
Seven years later, were just as fired up and ready to go.
Seven Years After the Recovery Act: My Trip Up the Mississippi to Check in on Americas Communities  The White House
Seven Years After the Recovery Act: My Trip Up the Mississippi to Check in on Americas Communities Infrastructure
It represented the largest clean-energy investment in our nations history and the biggest public works project since the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System.
And he put me in charge of getting it done.
Its fitting, then, that today Im heading to a region thats been the economic heart of America for a long time to check in on how the projects weve invested in are going.
Were going up the Mississippi River: From New Orleans to Memphis all the way up to St. Paul.
For well over two centuries, this region has connected agriculture with industrial power in the middle of Americawith not only the rest of the nation, but the rest of the world, as well. I do not exaggerate when I say that the abundance and industry of this part of the nation is the primary reason weve grown from a handful of states and a few million people to 50 states and 300-plus million people.
Lets take stock for a moment of exactly where we were back in 2009.
Over the whole of what weve come to refer to as the Great Recession, nearly 9 million people lost their jobs. More than 5 million people lost their homes, and millions more lost their savings. Markets were crashing. Businesses were closing. Home values were plummeting. Foreclosures were skyrocketing.
We enacted the Recovery Actlegislation designed, simply put, to save the economy from a depression and to save the middle class while investing in the industries that will drive economic growth in the future.
It was a mix of middle-class tax cuts; emergency relief to states to prevent layoffs of firefighters, police officers, and teachers, and cuts to vital services; and investments in the futureeverything from education to health care to energy and infrastructure.
Heres what I did when the President put me in charge of implementing it:
For months, I was regularly on the phone with mayors, governors, and other local leaders, making sure they had the resources they needed, making sure the Recovery Act was being implemented fairly, efficiently, and without waste.
Thats because none of these programs work simply by virtue of some announcement from on high from the federal government. They only work when you have governors and members of Congress who are on boardwho believe in the work, and pay attention to the details.
I visited and monitored Recovery Act projects around the countrybecause I knew if we didnt do it better than any program had done, our critics would say there was no sense in any further government investments in growing the economy, and we would never get a chance to do it again.
Since then, Im proud to say that this has been called the most successful economic recovery legislation since the New Deal. All told, it injected more than $800 billion into the economy. It brought tens of billions of dollars from private and local investors off the sidelines. And it was implemented wiselyconsidered one of the most efficiently administered economic programs in our history.
Theres a lot thats been done by and for women and girls, but theres still plenty to do. Convened by the White House, the Summit rallied all of us together to celebrate what weve achieved, and how The United State of Women and our allies are going to take action moving forward. Together, we can take on these key gender equality issues and make a powerful difference in our collective future.

Its Official: The Iran Deal Started This Weekend
Sunday marked the official "adoption day" for the "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action" better known as the Irandeal.
Now that the agreement is officially in place  after years of negotiations between Iran, the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, and endless worries that it wouldnt survive Congress  the worlds leaders and diplomats are waiting to see if it willwork.
"Adoption day" is not the same as "implementation day"  the U.S. wont start easing nuclear-power-related sanctions against Iran until the country has proved it is obeying the deal by doing things like decommissioning15,000 centrifuges, redesigning the Arak reactor, and reducing its enriched uranium stockpile. The United States expects Iran to complete these objectives in two to six months.However, President Barack Obama and leaders in the European Union set in motion all the paperwork to make the sanction lifting possible a few months down the road. Officials have been wary to fix a date to when implementation day might occur. As the New York Times points out, an official told reporters in September, "They clearly have motivation to try to accomplish those steps as soon as possible.But look, this is a very complicateddeal.
The United NationsInternational Atomic Energy Agency will be conducting the inspections to determine whether Iran has kept up its part of the deal. The finalreport on the countrys progress will be released on December 15.
After the IAEA gives Iran a thumbs-up  or tells its government it has more work to do  the next milestone will take place in 2023: "Transition Day." At that point, all of Irans remaining nuclear resources are supposed to be used for peaceful means. Ten years from now, if all goes according to plan, additional sanctions are supposed to belifted.
"I am confident in the extraordinary benefits to our national security and the peace and security of the world that come with the successful implementation of the [Iran deal]," Obama said in a statement onSunday.
However, there are plenty of ways that the process could continue to get complicated, even now that adoption day has come and gone. Some observers wonder how open Iranian officials will be with the U.N. inspectors. Other U.S. officials are frustrated by an Iranian courts decision to convict a Washington Post reporter of espionage. Last week, Iran tested a ballistic missile. One official told Reuters, This is not, unfortunately, something new. There is a long pattern of Iran ignoring UN security council resolutions on ballisticmissiles.
Secretary of State John Kerrynoted in a statement yesterday that he is very awarethat his job hasonly just begun when it comes to dealing with Iran and nukes. "I and my entire team will remain vigilant and mindful of not just how far we have come, but how much further we have to go in seeing that this deal is fully implemented," hesaid.

President Obama: The TPP would let America, not China, lead the way on global trade
Over the past six years, Americas businesses have created more than 14million new jobs. To keep this progress going, we need to pursue every avenue of economic growth. Today, some of our greatest economic opportunities abroad are in the Asia-Pacific region, which is on its way to becoming the most populous and lucrative market on the planet. Increasing trade in this area of the world would be a boon to American businesses and American workers, and it would give us a leg up on our economic competitors, including one we hear a lot about on the campaign trail these days: China.
Of course, Chinas greatest economic opportunities also lie in its own neighborhood, which is why China is not wasting any time. As we speak, China is negotiating a trade deal that would carve up some of the fastest-growing markets in the world at our expense, putting American jobs, businesses and goods at risk.
This past week, China and 15 other nations met in Australia with a goal of getting their deal, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, done before the end of this year. That trade deal wont prevent unfair competition among government-subsidized, state-owned enterprises. It wont protect a free and open Internet. Nor will it respect intellectual property rights in a way that ensures Americas creators, artists, filmmakers and entrepreneurs get their due. And it certainly wont enforce high standards for our workers and our environment.
Fortunately, America has a plan of our own that meets each of these goals. As a Pacific power, the United States has pushed to develop a high-standard Trans- Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that puts American workers first and makes sure we write the rules of the road for trade in the 21st century.
This agreement strengthens Americas economy. The TPP brings together 12countries representing nearly 40percent of the global economy to make sure that private firms have a fair shot at competing against state-owned enterprises. It keeps the Internet open and free. It strengthens the intellectual property protections our innovators need to take risks and create. And it levels the playing field by setting the highest enforceable standards and by removing barriers to selling our goods overseas  including the elimination of more than 18,000 taxes that other countries put on products made in America. Simply put, once the TPP is in place, American businesses will export more of what they make. And that means supporting more higher-paying jobs.
This agreement also strengthens Americas national security. When fewer people suffer in poverty, when our trading partners flourish and when we bind our economy closer to others in a strategically important region, America is both stronger and safer.
But none of this will happen if the TPP doesnt become a reality. Thats because the Asia-Pacific region will continue its economic integration, with or without the United States. We can lead that process, or we can sit on the sidelines and watch prosperity pass us by.
If we dont get the TPP done, American goods will continue to face high tariffs and other trade barriers in the region. American businesses will lose competitive access to Asian markets, which would mean fewer of the cars our autoworkers manufacture would make it to growing markets, more of our farmers and ranchers products would run into barriers abroad, and small-business owners hoping to sell their goods abroad would still find themselves ensnared in red tape. If we dont get the TPP done, employers across America will lose the chance to compete with other countries companies on a level playing field. And when American workers and businesses compete on a level playing field, no one can beat us.
I understand the skepticism people have about trade agreements, particularly in communities where the effects of automation and globalization have hit workers and families the hardest. But building walls to isolate ourselves from the global economy would only isolate us from the incredible opportunities it provides. Instead, America should write the rules. America should call the shots. Other countries should play by the rules that America and our partners set, and not the other way around.
Thats what the TPP gives us the power to do. Thats why my administration is working closely with leaders in Congress to secure bipartisan approval for our trade agreement, mindful that the longer we wait, the harder it will be to pass the TPP. The world has changed. The rules are changing with it. The United States, not countries like China, should write them. Lets seize this opportunity, pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership and make sure America isnt holding the bag, but holding the pen.

2016 State of the Union
When President Obama took office, we were facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Seven years later, our businesses have created 14.1 million new jobs over the past 70 months.Weve rebuilt our manufacturing base, reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector. Weve welcomed home more than 160,000 troops.
We are living through an extraordinary moment in human history. Technological and social change is reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our environment, and our place in the world.But as Americans, weve been through big changes before and, like generations past, we can make change work for us. In his speech, President Obama laid out his plan to seize opportunities before us.In looking forward, there are four big questions that we as a country have to answer.
How do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in the new economy?
How do we make technology work for us, and not against us, as we solve our biggest challenges?
How do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?
How can we make our politics reflect the best in us, and not the worst?
For all the challenges we face, the truth is that no country on Earth is better poised to seize the future than the United States.And if we answer these four basic questions, then there is nothing that America cant do.

World unites in tribute to victims of the Orlando nightclub massacre
Millions of people around the world have joined together to light candles and hold vigils in memory of the 49 people killed in the deadliest mass shooting in US history.
In dozens of countries and cities from London to South Korea, Copenhagen, Berlin, Bangkok and Australia, mourners have paid their respects to those brutally murdered by Omar Mateen, who opened fire in the gay club Pulse in Orlando on Sunday.
The gunman killed 49 people in a hail of bullets, and injured more than 50 in the massacre - sending shockwavesacross the globe.
Now landmarks across the world - from the Eiffel Tower in Paris to Syndey's Harbour Bridge, have been lit up in rainbow colours to show their solidarity with the LGBT community.
Terrorist Omar Mateen shot dead 49 people and wounded at least 53 more during the massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando in the early hours of Sunday morning  and called 911 just before the attack to pledge allegiance to ISIS.
Mateen, of Port St. Lucie in Florida, reportedly laughed as he sprayed bullets into the crowded club before he was shot dead by a SWAT team several hours after launching his horrific massacre with a legally bought assault rifle and pistol.
Hundreds of mourners -many wearing rainbow flags or holding placards -gathered in the heart of London's LGBT community to commemorate the 49 victims.
The lively Old Compton Street, Soho, fell silent at 7pm this evening as a sign of respect for the revellers slaughtered in Orlando on Sunday morning.
Flags bearing messages of hope fluttered in the wind and a number of the fists were raised defiantly in the air during the two-minute silence.
After observing the two minutes of silence, 49 balloons - one for each person killed - were released into the air.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Education Secretary Nicky Morgan were among a cross-party group of politicians at the event.
Labour leader Mr Corbyn said: 'Extraordinary turnout of people showing their solidarity against this awful crime and there is an amazing sense of coming together and unity here in London tonight indeed as it is all over the world.
'We have to live in a society where homophobic hate crime is a thing of the past and the deaths that happened in Orlando are a sign of something deeply awful.
'We're here in Old Compton Street because of what happened here and it's that sense of solidarity that we've got.
'Love, in the end, defeats this crime, because it's stronger.'
Following the two minutes of silence, the group - which also featured shadow chancellor John McDonnell and Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson - laid flowers at St Anne's Church to those killed in the atrocity.
A rendition of Simon and Garfunkel's hit Bridge Over Troubled Water was sung by London Gay Men's Chorus as the silence in London came to an end, followed by the road chanting: 'We're here, we're queer, we will not live in fear.'
Dozens of candles laid by mourners illuminated the St Anne's churchyard in the early dusk, while flowers were piled up at their side.
Nicky Morgan, who is also equalities minister, said of her decision to appear alongside members of opposing parties: 'I think this sort of tragic, horrific event in Orlando transcends normal party politics and we all wanted to be here to offer our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have suffered the most awful hate crime, fuelled by prejudice.
'I think it is very important - and quite moving - that the streets of London were filled with so many people who wanted to pay their tribute.'
Jerry and Ginger Updike, both from Orlando, had a friend who worked at the bar but had not been at the scene on the night of the killings.
'Orlando is probably the most LGBT friendly city, along with San Francisco and New York, and to have that happen in our own backyard is just surreal,' Mr Updike said.
'It's really amazing to see this event, right now we can't even do this in Orlando because the police have asked our friends not to do anything to detract from their resources because they need them to process what took place.
'I know that all around Florida and here we're getting a chance to do what those in Orlando aren't able to do right now - it feels good.'
Bradley Odd, another member of the LGBT community who had come down to pay his respects, said the killings had made him feel more fearful of going out.
He said: 'Growing up I was always afraid to go to gay bars anyway because you still get stories in the press every now and again of drive-by acid attacks.
'So when you finally start to come to terms with yourself and something like this happens, then it just reinforces that kind of stuff.'
He added: 'It might make me more reluctant to go out, but I'd still go out anyway because I think that is what people need to do.
Hundreds of people also lit candles and laid flowers in Glasgow as the names of the victims gunned down were read aloud in George Square.
Rainbow Pride flags - a symbol of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community - were planted in the square and cards and messages were laid beside flowers and candles.
Glasgow Mayor Sadie Docherty told the 600-strong crowd that the city stood in solidarity with Orlando as she placed a bouquet in the square which had a Scottish and US flag inside it.
Earlier, the Pride flag was raised at the Scottish Government's headquarters in Edinburgh.A similar vigil has also been organised in Edinburgh on Wednesday.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: 'Scotland stands in solidarity with the people of Orlando, and LGBTI communities across the world.'
The flag was also flying at half mast above Glasgow City Chambers, overlooking George Square.
Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale, who confirmed she was gay two months ago, described the attack as 'utterly heart-breaking'.
She said: 'This looks to have been an attack on the very freedom to love who you want to love. We stand in solidarity with the entire LGBT community and the vast majority of Americans who will oppose this hate.'
Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell and former Green Party leader Natalie Bennett - along with thousands of Londoners - stood together in solidarity tonight with those who died in the Orlando massacre.
Mr Tatchell, 64, held a poster which read 'Commemorate Orlando victims - schools must educate against hate' at the well-attended vigil on Old Compton Street at the heart of London's gay village.
The veteran human rights campaigner said it was crucial that gay venues and events in Britain 'redoubled their security'.
He said: 'The vigil was a huge act of solidarity and defiance.We are here, we are queer and we refuse to live in fear.
'Given the attack in Orlando it is common sense that gay venues and events need to improve their security.If that means more bag searches then so be it.The number one priority is to insure that gay venues are safe and secure places.'
Ms Bennett, 50, who was one of several politicians to attend the vigil in Soho, also held up a poster to show solidarity with the LGBT community.
She said: 'We're standing right outside the Admiral Duncan where not that long ago we saw a similar attack.'
She said of the vigil: 'I would have thought there were at least six to eight thousand people here on Old Compton Street.
'Politics should be something you do not something that is done to you and to stop homophobia people should stand up against discrimination.
'There should be human rights for everybody.It was very moving. It was two minute of absolute silence, of three people coming together.'
Mr Tatchell added:'I suspect that the London LGBT pride this year will be bigger than ever.
'There will be a very strong focus of solidarity.
'It is truly shocking. The bloody scale of this massacre is almost beyond comprehension.'
Tom Bollman, 32, who attended the London vigil with his husband Derek Fhuff, believes the sickening attack at Pulse nightclub was particularly shocking because it took place at a venue where gay people feel safest.
Mr Bollman, born in San Diego but who has lived in London for 11 years, said of the vigil: 'It was great. It's excellent that so many people came out to support the people of Orlando.
'I went to Pulse during an event called Gay Day Orlando six years ago and it was great, I had a lot of fun.
'It's quite a popular club among our community.
'The security then was pretty relaxed: they pat you down and that was it. They do not check you, unless you have a bag.
'In Orlando the guy just stormed the place. I don't think there was a lot that could be done.'
Tom, who works as a para-legal in London, added: 'I do not feel threatened coming out in Soho, but in other places I have to think about whether it's safe to hold my husband's hand.
'The fact that the massacre was at a gay bar where people usually feel safe and relaxed is part of why it was so shocking.
'That, I think, is what's brought people out in solidarity.'
An outpouring of sympathy streamed in from around the world as millions reacted to the Florida mass shooting, with millions takingto social media to post their shock and write messages of support for the victims, angry that part of the killer's motive for the attack appears to have been the sexuality of his victims.

Were taking action on climate change  and the world is joining us
Were taking action on climate changeand the world is joiningus Last November, President Obama stood in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing alongside Chinese President Xi Jinpingand made history. The leaders of the worlds two largest economiesand two biggest emitters of greenhouse gasessurprised the global community by jointly announcing their plans to combat one of the biggest threats facing the world this century: Climate change. China, for the first time, committed to a specific date for peaking their emissionsand showed how they would get there by also pledging to build more zero-carbon energy generation than they currently have in coal power. President Obama announced that the United States would build on the historic progress weve already made to cut carbon pollution and protect public health by reducing emissions 2628 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. Today, the United States followed through on that joint announcement by officially submitting our targetor intended nationally determined contribution, in the jargon of the international climate negotiationsto the UNFCCC. The World Is Acting to Take On Climate Change With todays submission of the U.S. target, countries accounting for more than half of total carbon pollution from the energy sector have submitted or announced what they will do in the post-2020 period to combat climate change. That includes Mexico, our close economic partner, which set a high standard of ambition for similar countries when they became the first emerging economy to submit their climate target to the UN, committing last Friday to peak their greenhouse gas emissions across their economy by 2026.
Thats a big deal, because truly global challenges demand global solutions. Climate change is real, it is being driven by human activity, and it is not a problem any one country can solve on its own. The United States Is Leading the Charge The United States target is ambitious and achievable, and we have the tools we need to reach it. The goal will roughly double the pace at which were reducing carbon pollution through cost-effective measures using laws already on the books.
What does that mean in practice? In our formal submission to the UN, we lay out several of the policies we are already using to achieve this goal, including the Presidents historic fuel economy standards for cars, trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles; energy efficiency measures for buildings and appliances; and programs to phase down the potent climate pollutants known as HFCs, which have up to 10,000 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. We also highlight ongoing activities that will further reduce our greenhouse gas emissionsincluding upcoming rules to limit methane emissions from the oil and gas sector and the EPAs Clean Power Plan to curb carbon pollution from existing power plants, the single-biggest source of U.S. emissions. These policies deliver real benefits to the American people. The Presidents fuel economy standards mean our cars can go twice as far on a gallon of gas, and because of higher efficiency and lower gas prices, drivers will save an average of $750 at the pump this year. When fully implemented, the EPAs Clean Power Plan will prevent up to 6,600 premature deaths and 150,000 juvenile asthma attacks annually.
We Have the Tools We Need to Act on Climate The fact is, we can take on climate change, grow the economy, and create more jobs and opportunity for the American people at the same time. Over the last eight years, weve cut more carbon pollution than any other country and brought our economy back from the biggest economic downturn since the Great Depression, creating more than 12 million jobs over 60 straight months of job growththe longest streak on record. Since the EPA was established four decades ago, weve cut air pollution by 70 percent while our GDP has tripled. Were seeing encouraging trends in the global economy, too. For more than four decades, carbon pollution from the energy sector rose alongside increases in global GDP. The only periods where carbon emissions didnt increase corresponded to periods of economic weakness. Until last year. In an historic but underreported shift, carbon pollution from the energy sector was flat from 2013 to 2014even as the global economy grew by 3 percent.
Thats a big deal, and is yet another sign that we have the tools we need to tackle climate change head-on. The IEA attributed last years flat-lining of carbon pollution from the energy sector to new policies in places like China, the EU and the United Statesas we deploy more clean energy, use less dirty energy, and use less energy overall, while still growing the economy and creating jobs. Clean energy is key to climate actionand theres good news on that front, too. During the Presidents time in office, the United States has tripled the amount of energy we get from wind and increased solar generation more than tenfold. And renewable energy is getting more affordable. The cost of solar in particular is declining rapidly, and were on track to achieve a central goal of the Presidents SunShot initiativeto reduce the total installed cost of solar energy systems to 6 cents per kilowatt hour by 2020. In addition to being a historic moment of shared ambition, the U.S.-China joint announcement last November served a powerful market signal for these technologiesthat the worlds two largest energy users will continue their increased investment in low-carbon and zero-carbon energy solutions. The Time for Climate Action Is Now Most challenges arise suddenly, with little warning. Climate change is different. For decades, weve known why global average temperatures are rising, why greenhouse gas concentrations are increasing, why the oceans are warming and weather patterns are growing more extreme. For decades, weve known what we need to do to address this threat, and to prevent our children from inheriting a planet that is damaged beyond their capacity to repair. Over time, the warning signs have grown more alarming. 2014 was the hottest year on record. 14 of the 15 hottest years on record have come in this century. Ice sheets are melting, the seas are rising, snow packs are diminishing, and communities around the world have been battered by severe storms. Its past time we heed these warnings. Its past time for the world to take action. Under President Obamas leadership, the United States is doing our part to take on this global challenge. Its time for other countries to do what the United States, Mexico, and the E.U. members have done and submit timely, transparent, measurable, and above all ambitious targets for cutting carbon pollution and building lower-carbon economies to the UNFCCC. In the meantime, the President will seize every opportunity to make progress on climate change at home and on the international stageas we look toward forging a global agreement on climate change in Paris this December and beyond.

The Final State of the Union
Obama creates the largest protected place on the planet, in Hawaii
President Obama on Friday created the largest ecologically protected area on the planet when he expanded a national marine monument in his native Hawaii to encompass more than half a million square miles.
The president more than quadrupled the size of the Papahanaumokuakea (pronounced Papa-ha-now-moh-koo-ah-kay-ah) Marine National Monument to 582,578 square miles of land and sea in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.
President George W. Bush established the monument a decade ago, but Obamas action Friday underscores the high priority he has placed on issues of conservation and climate change in his second term. The president has now used his executive authority under the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect more than 548 million acres of federal land and water, more than double the set-asides of any of his predecessors.
Many scientists, environmentalists and Native Hawaiians have argued for more stringent protections for the biologically rich region, given important deep-water discoveries in the area and the dual threats of climate change and sea-bed mining.
The oceans are the untold story when it comes to climate change, and we have to feel a sense of urgency when it comes to protecting the ocean that sustains us, said Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who helped broker a compromise with groups including Native Hawaiians and day-boat fishermen.
In his official proclamation, Obama declared, It is in the public interest to preserve the marine environment.
All commercial extraction activities, including fishing and future deep-sea mining, will be prohibited in the expanded monument area. However, recreational fishing, removal of resources for traditional Hawaiian cultural purposes and scientific research will be allowed with a federal permit.
Obama will highlight his action in an address Wednesday to the Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders and the IUCN World Conservation Congress in Honolulu, and will travel the following day to Midway Atoll, which is located within the current monument.
The president has unilaterally established more than two dozen national monuments, most of them in his second term. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama would be happy to sign into law a piece of legislation that would have protected these waters, but we havent seen that kind of legislative activity in this Congress, and it means the president has had to make more effective use of his executive authority.
Longline fishermen lobbied against any new protections, arguing that their industry rejects damaging practices such as trawling and needs flexibility to sustain an annual catch valued at more than $100million.
We move all over the ocean, in the way the fish move, said Jim Cook, co-owner of POP Fishing and Marine, a Honolulu store, adding that the new restrictions mean 60percent of federal waters off Hawaii are now closed to fishing.
With Fridays action, seven presidents  starting with Theodore Roosevelt in 1909  have taken steps to safeguard parts of the archipelago, which is one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world. It is the planets largest seabird gathering site, with more than 14million birds from 22 species, and is home to nearly all Laysan albatrosses and the remaining endangered Hawaiian monk seals.
Recent research expeditions have unearthed extraordinary features beyond the existing monument boundaries, such as the worlds oldest living animal  a black coral estimated to be 4,500 years old  and six massive seamounts, one of which is nearly 14,000 feet high and teeming with life. This area also includes the wreckage of the USS Yorktown, which sank during the Battle of Midway in 1942 and has not been visited since it was discovered there in 1998.
Daniel Wagner, a researcher at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who served as the scientific lead for the agencys deep-water expeditions in the region a year ago and again in February, said every one of the 50 biological samples that remotely operated vehicles recovered were either new species or not known to live in the area.
Were seeing a lot of life, a lot of new life and a lot of very old life, he said. Things have not been disturbed for a very long time.
Wagner said he is particularly concerned about future underwater mineral extraction, given the rich deposits of manganese, nickel, zinc, cobalt and titanium in the region. If theyre not protected, theyre going to be exposed to mining, he said.
Matt Rand, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts Global Ocean Legacy program, said that intact ecosystems such as these offer a glimpse of what our planet was like before the impacts of human activity, and it is critical that we preserve places in this way, both as a window to the past and for future generations.
Schatz suggested a change to the proposal that carved out areas where day-boat fishermen in Kauai and Niihau can continue operating. His suggestion won the support of influential state officials such as Democratic state Sen. Ron Kouchi. Kouchi said in an interview that he could back Obamas expansion as long as it is the last one.
One of the questions the fishermen are asking is, When will it stop? he said.
Federal officials estimate that 5percent of current commercial fishing efforts will be displaced. Longline operators already catch about half their fish in international waters, and they reached their annual catch limit for big-eye tuna in early August.
However, Sean Martin, president of the Hawaii Longline Association, said the industrys fleet of 145 boats could not match the lobbying power of well-financed environmental groups such as Pew.
Were obviously going up against environmental organizations that have billions of dollars, Martin said. For somebody to feel good, were going to force U.S. fishermen out of waters.
Republicans have accused Obama of abusing his authority under the Antiquities Act, which says any protections must be confined to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected.
But Richard Pyle, a researcher at Hawaiis Bishop Museum, said he and other scientists have concluded that the ecological interconnectedess of the region  including the fish larvae that are dispersed on currents, and the sharks and other pelagic fish that travel vast distances  extends beyond federal waters.
The minimum space necessary for protection, its more about 350 to 380 miles, but of course we dont have the jurisdiction for doing so, Pyle said.
Some Native Hawaiian activists, moreover, lobbied for greater protection so they could continue to observe traditional voyaging practices in which they navigate without instruments. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs will serve as trustees in managing the monument.
William Aila, a former state official and Hawaiian activist, said Thursday that the presidents move will preserve a cultural seascape, with the history of the Polynesians who migrated up to Hawaii.
He recalled that when he journeyed to Mokumanamana, or Necker Island, in 2009, you could feel the presence of your ancestors, not just in the earth but in the symphony of birds, all night and all day long.
Asked what he thought of the monument expansion, Aila switched to Hawaiian. Olu olu, he said. In English, thats very pleasant.

Bill Simmons Interviews President Obama, s 2015 Man of the Year
The leader of the free world sits down with the free agent of the yearHBOs Bill Simmonsto discuss the Obama era and beyond. The exclusive White House Q&A
But what I didnt fully appreciate, and nobody can appreciate until theyre in the position, is how decentralized power is in this system. When youre in the seat and youre seeing the housing market collapse and you are seeing unemployment skyrocketing and you have a sense of what the right thing to do is, then you realize, Okay, not only do I have to persuade my own party, not only do I have to prevent the other party from blocking what the right thing to do is, but now I can anticipate this lawsuit, this lobbying taking place, and this federal agency that technically is independent, so I cant tell them what to do. Ive got the Federal Reserve, and Im hoping that they do the right thingand by the way, since the economy now is global, Ive got to make sure that the Europeans, the Asians, the Chinese, everybody is on board. A lot of the work is not just identifying the right policy but now constantly building these ever shifting coalitions to be able to actually implement and execute and get it done.
Did it take time during the presidency to realize what kind of moments those were?
Yes, sometimes its feel. Sometimes the circumstances wont give you a clean statement. The fact that race has always been the fault line of our society and has always distorted our politicsthat is not subject to argument. Part of what youre looking for is a way not to just vent but to actually move the people. I practiced law for a whilea lot of times, hard cases can make bad law. If you have an issue that you want to put forward, youre looking for the right plaintiff and the right court to appear before. I do think as you go on as president, you get a better feel for this, but youre not always going to be perfect. When the Trayvon Martin case happened, I had an honest response as a father that I think resonated with a lot of people. When Ferguson happened, there was a gap between how quickly we could pull together a police task force, recommendations. And so in that lag, it feels as if I havent spoken to the moment as effectively. I suspect that if I were to do it over again, there might be something I could say that wouldve crystallized it more effectively. But Fergusonthe case itself was tougher because people didnt know what was going on exactly. In some ways the [Eric] Garner case in New York was clearer because you had on videotape exactly what had happened, and some of the subsequent cases have been more obvious.
The lack of HD really hurtsyou can barely see anybody.
Its trueand the graphics at the bottom are terrible. But a thing that youre reminded of, watching those old Bulls games, is Jordan had some stinker games in the playoffs. But he would get that out of his mind, and then the next moment comes and hes right there. He could have a terrible game for the first three quarters and then suddenly go crazy the fourth. Or he might miss a free throw, and then the next play is hes stealing the ball and hitting the game-winning shot. Part of what I try to donot at the level that Jordan did on the basketball court, but part of what you aspire to as president or any of these positions of leadershipis to try to figure out how to be in the moment, make the best decision you can, know that youre going to get a bunch of them right, but a bunch of times youre also not going to get it exactly the way you want it.
Gun control: Youve tried to legislate it as much as you possibly could and hit a wall basically in every direction. But the one thing Hillary Clinton has brought up is executive action.
Well, keep in mind that after Sandy Hook, we put forward 23 executive actions. So we havent been asleep at the switch in terms of executive actions that weve tried. There are maybe a few more that had to be scrubbed by lawyers because, essentially, with every executive action, we can count on it being challenged by somebody in Congress or, in this case, the NRA. We want to make any executive action we take as defensible as possible legally. In the absence of a movement politically in which people say, Enough is enough, were going to continue to see, unfortunately, these tragedies take place. The main thing that Ive been trying to communicate over the last several of these horrific episodes is that, contrary to popular belief, Americans are not more violent than people in other developed countries. But they have more deadly weapons to act out their rage, and thats the only main variable that you see between the U.S. and these other countries.

Yeah, youre not the coolest person in their lives anymore.
And you just have to let go, you have to acknowledge that if you say to them, Hey, you want to go watch this movie? or Hey, you want to go take a swim at the pool? No, sorry, Daddy. I love you, though. See you tomorrow, cause Im spending the night at somebodys house. The golden age is between, say, 6, 7, and 12, and theyre your buddies and they just want to hang out. And after that, they will love you, but they dont have that much time for you. And my understanding is, based on friends of mine who have older kids, is that with a little bit of luck, as long as youre not so completely annoying during these teenage years, theyll come back to you around 23, 24, and actually want to hang out with you. But that stretch is painful. The compensation you get for the fact that they dont have time for you is: Nothing beats watching your children become smarter and cooler than you are. And you suddenly will hear them say something or make a joke or have an insight and you go, Wow. I didnt think of that.

What Can the President Do to Help Workers Who Need a Sick Day? We Asked Him.
Slate took the opportunity of an email interview with the president to ask about how future administrations could continue using executive power to improve the lot of workerswhich, beyond action at the city and state level, is the best progressives can hope for on the issue in the near future. (I also chatted with Secretary of Labor Tom Perez about the subject. The conversation is airing as a special Slate bonus podcast on Thursday.) The Obama administration has also been pushing the interesting, and I think accurate, idea that workplace issues like family and sick leave are actually macroeconomic issues because of their impacts on the labor force. We discussed how the executive branch can set an example as an employer, how flimsy leave policies perpetuate the gender gap, and why even generous paid sick leave isnt enough.
Thats a great observation. We definitely adopted a broad definition of sick leave, just as many states, localities, and businesses have. Obviously you can use the sick days if you have the flu, or another illness, and need to rest and recover. They also can be used for preventive care, like an annual physical or dentist appointment. We also make these days available to be used as safe days for a survivor of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. So if you need to seek medical care, obtain counseling, look for new housing, or pursue a protective order in court, youre covered.
If you need to stay home with a sick child or care for a spouse after a surgery, that counts, too. The same goes for caring for a newborn, such as in those first few days when they are still in the hospital or have their first important appointments with the pediatrician. That being said, seven days is just not enough time to spend caring for a newborn. Thats why Ive also called on Congress to pass a real paid family and medical leave bill so that all working Americans can care for new children, or a seriously ill parent or spouse, without having to leave their jobs or worry about not being paid. Its why its such a big deal that the state of New York passed a sweeping paid family and medical leave bill this year that will provide up to 12 weeks of leave when its fully phased in. And its why California recently expanded its longstanding paid family leave program to boost wage replacement, making it easier for parents to take time away from their jobs to care for their new children.
But even more importantly, the question we should be asking is: What is the cost of not providing paid sick leave? We lose incredible talent in our workforce every year as millions of Americans are faced with the absurd choice of going to work sick or staying home and losing their pay, or perhaps even their jobs. How much more effective will businesses be when their sick employees stay at home to recover instead of getting their co-workers sick, too? During the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, one report estimated that 8 million Americans showed up to work and spread the illness to another 7 million coworkers. This presenteeism and its reductions in productivity due to the spread of illness in the workplace may cost American businesses an estimated $160 billion each year. Is offering paid sick leave really too high a price to pay?
The same applies to paid family and medical leave. How much more efficient will employees be when they can take concentrated time off to care for their 2-week-old, or their sick kid, or their partner after a surgery? Do businesses really think that those individuals are showing up ready to work each day? They arent. Theyre preoccupied. Many are weighing the decision of whether they need to find a more flexible job or leave the workforce entirely. And many of them will. So businesses lose skilled workers and spend a good chunk of that employees annual salary trying to replace them.
We also know that when leave is unpaid, men are less likely to take it. They stay at work. So if dads stay at work, moms take on more of the housework and child care from the time the first child is born. Throughout my life, I saw my own grandmother and mother take off a disproportionate amount of time to care for sick loved ones or to care for the kids. And today its still something that is unbalanced between men and women. Ive seen how Michelle balanced the demands of a busy career and raising a family. Like many working mothers, she worried about the expectations and judgments of how she should handle the tradeoffs, knowing that few people would question my choices.

2016 State of the Union
When President Obama took office, we were facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Seven years later, our businesses have created 14.1 million new jobs over the past 70 months.Weve rebuilt our manufacturing base, reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector. Weve welcomed home more than 160,000 troops.
We are living through an extraordinary moment in human history. Technological and social change is reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our environment, and our place in the world.But as Americans, weve been through big changes before and, like generations past, we can make change work for us. In his speech, President Obama laid out his plan to seize opportunities before us.In looking forward, there are four big questions that we as a country have to answer.
How do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in the new economy?
How do we make technology work for us, and not against us, as we solve our biggest challenges?
How do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?
How can we make our politics reflect the best in us, and not the worst?
For all the challenges we face, the truth is that no country on Earth is better poised to seize the future than the United States.And if we answer these four basic questions, then there is nothing that America cant do.
Clean energy employs 2.5 million in US: Report
The clean energy industry in the U.S. employs over 2.5 million people, according to new analysis released by Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), a nonpartisan business group. 
The findings in a report, "Clean Jobs America", show that the energy efficiency sector employs 1.9 million Americans, with other sectors such as solar and wind accounting for 299,000 and 77,000 workers respectively.
"In a short amount of time, clean energy has become a huge part of our workforce and our economy," Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, said in a statement.
The analysis is based on data from the Department of Energy and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, together with a "comprehensive survey" of thousands of businesses.

Fresh Climate Data Confirms 2015 Is Unlike Any Other Year in Human History
Over the past few days, a bevy of climate data has come together to tell a familiar yet shocking story: Humans have profoundly altered the planets life-support system, with 2015 increasingly likely to be an exclamation point on recent trends.
On Monday, scientists at Britains national weather service, the Met Office, said our planet will finish this year more than one degree Celsius warmer than preindustrial levels for the first time. That figure is halfway to the line in the sand that scientists say represents dangerous climate change and global leaders have committed to avoidan ominous milestone.
This years global heat waveabout two-tenths of a degree warmer than 2014, a massive leap when averaged over the entire planetcan be blamed most immediately on an exceptionally strong El Niobut wouldnt exist without decades of heat-trapping emissions from fossil fuel burning. Separate data released on Monday by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed the current El Nio, a periodic warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean, has now tied 1997 for the strongest event ever measured, at least on a weekly basis.
"We've had similar natural events in the past, yet this is the first time we are set to reach the 1 degree marker and it's clear that it is human influence driving our modern climate into uncharted territory," said Stephen Belcher, director of the Met Offices Hadley Centre in a statement.
If that wasnt enough, the World Meteorological Organization, a division of the United Nations, also confirmed on Monday that global carbon dioxide levels reached a new record high in 2014for the 30th consecutive year. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more efficient the planet is at trapping the suns heat, and so global temperatures rise. Since our carbon dioxide emissions have a lifespan of a hundred years or so, theres a significant lag in this processtemperatures will keep rising for decades even if all human emissions ceased today.
That means not only will 2015 end up as the planets warmest year in millenniaand probably since the invention of agriculture more than 10,000 years agobut that theres a lot more warming thats already baked into the global climate system.
All that extra heat is already changing the planet in complex ways. For example, as of last week, theres fresh evidence that the Atlantic Oceans fundamental circulation system is slowing down.
Over the past few years, a notoriously persistent cold patch of ocean has emerged just south of Greenland in the north Atlantic. There have been several theories as to why this is happening, but most involve a slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, part of the global oceanic conveyor belt system of heat and water that helps regulate the Earths climate by cooling off the tropics and gently warming polar regions.
The AMOC is so important that its slowdown has been linked to past episodes of abrupt climate change, like a three-degree Celsius drop in Northern Hemisphere temperatures in less than 20 years about 8,000 years ago, and formed the highly dramatized basis for the planetary chaos featured in The Day After Tomorrow. Earlier this year, an important study provided further strong evidence that melting ice from Greenland has begun to disrupt and slow down the oceans circulation by changing the density of the north Atlantic, with profound consequences: In 2009, East Coast sea levels sharplyand temporarilyjumped by about four inches as water piled up. Stronger winter storms and an interruption of the Atlantic marine food chain also may already be happening.
According to a new analysis released last week, scientists used data from a pair of NASA satellites to track climate-related changes in the north Atlanticthe first time ocean currents have been tracked from space. Over the last decade, the satellites were able to take highly precise measurements of the literal weight of the ocean between Florida and Iceland that corroborated measurements from a network of ocean buoys over the same general place and time. From that information, they were able to calculate that the Atlantics circulation is indeed slowing down, a potential climate tipping point thats been long predicted to occur at some point in the 21st century. Call it one more data point from a rapidly changing planet.
Still, despite the blindingly clear data, theres hope that the tide couldfinallybe shifting on climate change. Later this month, world leaders will be gathering in Paris and are widely expected to agree to the first-ever global agreement to constrain future emissions trajectories in a meaningful waypossibly enough to avoid the worst-case climate scenario.

For the first time ever, Americas uninsured rate has fallen below 9 percent
Fewer Americans are uninsured than ever before, new federal data shows.
Quarterly numbers from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) show that the uninsured rate fell to 8.6 percent during the first three months of 2016. Thats the lowest rate the government has on record.
The NCHS data shows states that chose to expand Medicaid programs have cut their uninsured rate in half, while states that opted out of Medicaid expansion programs have not seen as dramatic of a decline.
It also finds that more and more Americans are enrolled in high-deductible insurance plans  and those with the highest uninsured rates are young adults between the ages of 25 and 34.
States that opted to expand Medicaid coverage to include lower-income individuals have managed to cut their uninsured rate from 18.4 percent in 2013 to 9.2 percent in the first three months of 2016.
But for the 19 states that have opted not to expand Medicaid, the decrease in the uninsured rate has not been as substantial, falling from 22.7 percent in 2013 to 16.7 percent in 2016.
Adults in states with an insurance marketplace managed by the federal government were also more likely to be uninsured than those individuals living in states with a state-based marketplace.
Of the 178.5 million Americans covered by private health insurance, 10.8 million, or 4 percent, are currently covered by private plans obtained through the Obamacare marketplaces. This marks a 0.4 percentage point increase from 2015 enrollment totals, which the NCHS says is not statistically significant.
More people who purchase private health insurance are enrolling in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP). Forty percent of people under the age of 45 with private health insurance were enrolled in an HDHP, compared with 36.7 percent in 2015. Thats also a nearly 15 percentage point increase from 2010, when only 25.3 percent of individuals were enrolled in an HDHP.
Adults ages 25 to 34 are almost twice as likely to lack health insurance than older adults ages 45 to 64.
As of 2016, 15.9 percent of adults ages 25 to 34 lack health insurance, compared with 8.1 percent of adults ages 45 to 64. Similarly, adults ages 18 to 24 and 35 to 44 also report high rates of uninsurance  13.7 percent and 14.3 percent, respectively.
While other demographic groups have experienced steep declines in the uninsured rate, most age groups have only experienced modest changes since 2010. The 18-to-24 age group has experienced the most dramatic decline but still reports a high percentage (14.3 percent) of uninsured individuals.
Since 2013, Americas poorest adults have experienced some of the greatest declines in the uninsured rate, but as of the first three months of 2016, those steady declines might be tapering off.
No significant change was reported in the percentage of poor uninsured adults from 2015 to 2016. The uninsured rate did drop for wealthier adults, however, falling from 7.6 percent in 2015 to 6.5 percent in the early months of 2016.
The uninsured rate has fallen most dramatically for nonwhite adults since 2013. For Hispanic adults, the uninsured rate has been cut nearly in half, dropping from 40.6 percent in 2013 to 24.5 percent in 2016.
African Americans and Asian Americans have also experienced steep declines in uninsured rates, as have white Americans, though not nearly as dramatically as their Hispanic peers.
OFA organizers tell senators: Do your job
Today, President Obama announced his Supreme Court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. But Senate leaders are still refusing to even meet with him, using partisan politics to make excuses about not doing their jobs.In the past month, OFA organizers have been speaking out with a message for their senators: Do your job.On March 3, volunteers gathered in 23 states for a day of action focused on the Supreme Court vacancy. OFA supporters and partners made their voices heard, calling on senators in each state to give President Obama's Supreme Court nominee a fair hearing and a timely vote.In California, chapters from all over the state convened at San Francisco City Hall to thank their senators for committing to do their jobsand to encourage other senators to do theirs. In Kansas City, volunteers visited Senator Roy Blunt's office and spoke with members of his staff, urging the senator to give fair consideration to President Obama's Supreme Court nominee. And in New Mexico, volunteers created an installation featuring the faces of the eight current Supreme Court justices.
Global Climate Accord Closer to Reality as Obama, Xi Sign On
U.S. President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping formally joined the Paris climate agreement, and with the worlds two largest emitters of carbon pollution now on board the deal among more than 190 countries may enter into force this year.
The submission to the United Nations solidifies one of Obamas most ambitious efforts to combat climate change by persuading China to join efforts to curb pollution. The pact is aimed at limiting global temperature increases from pre-industrial levels to well below 2 degrees Celsius. Obama began his week-long trip to Asia with a ceremony hailing the accord, seeking to set the tone for his final presidential visit to a region where he has struggled to re-focus U.S. foreign policy.
We are moving the world significantly closer to the goal we set, Obama said Saturday in Hangzhou, China. This is not a fight any one country, no matter how powerful, can take alone.
The two leaders, who held a bilateral meeting before the opening of the G-20 summit, also agreed to work together on limiting pollution from international aviation and hydrofluorocarbons.
Despite our differences on other issues, we hope our willingness to work together on this issue will inspire greater ambition and greater action across the world, Obama said.
While Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has pledged to cancel and renegotiate the Paris agreement if he wins election, ratification by China and the U.S. would make that more difficult. The accord provides for it to go into effect when countries producing 55 percent of global emissions ratify it; China and the U.S. together account for about 38 percent.
Xi said the announcement hopefully will encourage other countries to take similar actions.
Briefing reporters on Friday, Brian Deese, a senior adviser to the president who focuses on environmental issues, said the action by the U.S. and China may accelerate a process that, according to conventional wisdom, would take several years, perhaps a couple of years.
Altogether, countries representing about 40 percent of global emissions have ratified the agreement since it was first signed in December, with several other countries on track to do so in the coming months, Deese said.
The U.S.-China accord puts the Paris agreement within reach by the end of 2016, much quicker than anyone anticipated when countries negotiated the final agreement, theNatural Resources Defense Council said in a blog post written by Jake Schmidt, director of the environmental groups international program, and Alvin Lin, its China program climate and energy policy director.
Under the agreement, China has said its emissions will peak in about 2030, and the U.S. has said it would cut greenhouse gases by 26 percent to 28 percent over the two decades ending in 2025.
For a QuickTake on the Climate Change pact, click here.
Obama, who will be addressing weak global growth and several international crises during his final G-20 summit, is pointing to the climate agreement with China as a bright spot on the international scene.
Climate will be a centerpiece of our agenda at the meeting, Obama said Wednesday during a stop in his native Hawaii en route to Hangzhou. Joint U.S.-Chinese leadership was part of the reason that we were able to get Paris done.
The U.S. is also entering into a joint agreement with China to work on other climate issues beyond the Paris agreement.
The two countries agreed to support and join an international aviation agreement to curb emissions from global air travel. China and the U.S. sought to spur other countries to join that pact through their example, Deese said.
White House officials also are hoping to secure an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, an international treaty designed to phase out the production of chemicals that deplete the ozone layer. The U.S. and China agreed to support a freeze date for when to begin phasing out production of hydro-fluorocarbons, which are commonly used as refrigerants and can contribute to global warming.
Obama and Xi, at odds on issues including the South China Sea and cybersecurity, formally submitted their ratification of the Paris Agreement to United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday.
By quickly signing on, the pair are signaling to other countries that the Paris agreement can come into force this year, Lou Leonard, vice president for climate and energy at the World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement. Even six months ago, this seemed an impossible idea.
The deal between the leading climate antagonists means neither can continue to blame the others inaction, which in turn sets an example the rest of the world can hardly ignore, Bob Perciasepe, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, said in a statement.

July was absolutely Earths hottest month ever recorded
NOAA and NASA data reveal the Earths temperature reached its highest point in 136 years of record-keeping during July.
July 2016 was absolutely the hottest month since the instrumental records began, tweeted Gavin Schmidt, who directs NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is responsible for temperature measurements.
It was the 15th straight month of recording-breaking temperatures in NOAAs analysis and 10th-straight in NASAs, passing the previous hottest Julys by substantial margins.
Its a little alarming to me that were going through these records like nothing this year, said Jason Furtado, a professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.
Each month just gives another data point that makes the evidence stronger that were changing the climate, added Simon Donner, professor of climatology at the University of British Columbia.
July is usually the hottest month of the year, as it coincides with the peak of summer in the Northern Hemisphere. But this July was more than 1.5 degrees above average in both NOAA and NASAs analyses.
July 2016 was the 379th consecutive month with temperatures at least nominally above the 20th century average, NOAA said.
Most of the planets land and ocean areas were warmer than normal in July. Parts of the Arctic were more than 7 degrees (4 Celsius) above average.
Warmer- to much-warmer-than-average temperatures were observed across much of all land masses, with record warmth observed mainly across parts of Indonesia, southern Asia, and New Zealand, NOAA said.
Blistering heat scorchedthe Middle East. Mitribah, Kuwait, simmered to 129.2 degrees which, if confirmed, would mark the hottest temperature ever recorded in the Eastern Hemisphere.
[Two Middle East locations hit 129 degrees, hottest ever in Eastern Hemisphere]
Furtado said the record global warmth was connected to extreme weather events happening around the world, such as the urban flooding in Ellicott City, Maryland, and record flooding in China. The two are going hand-in-hand, and theyre giving us a picture of what a future world might look like, he said.
An independent analysis of the global temperature from the Japan Meteorological Agency corroborated Julys record warmth:
The planets temperature has steadily risen in recent decades as heat-trapping gases have accumulated in the atmosphere. But temperatures have recently spiked, setting record highs two years in a row, in 2014 and 2015. One of the strongest El Nio events on record, dispersing heat from the Pacific Ocean into the atmosphere, has given temperatures an extra boost.
The El Nio event ended this spring, and the planets temperature difference from normal is no longer as remarkably high as it was earlier in the year. But it still remains at record highs.
Theres been so much talk about El Nio this year, but this [warming] is not just El Nio, said Donner. The records set in 2016 have crushed the records set in previous El Nios.
NASAs Schmidt said there is a 99 percent chance 2016 will become the hottest year on record, passing 2015 and 2014.
The Earths average temperature year-to-date ranks as the warmest on record by a hefty margin of 0.34 degrees (above 2015, the next warmest year), NOAA said.

Climate change has been making western forest fires worse for decades, study says
Many scientists have predicted that climate change could cause wildfires to increase in the future. Anda new study, just out on Monday, demonstratesjust how much its already been making them worse.
The paper, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests the effects of climate change have been helping make forests in the western United States in states including New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and everything else to the west  drier and easier to burn since the 1970s. And in the last three decades, the study finds climate change played a role in nearly doubling the area hit by forest fires since 1984.
A primary way climate influences fire seasons is by causing the local vegetation to dry out, through changes in temperature, precipitation or other factors. Previous studies have suggested theres an incredibly strong and reliable relationship between the dryness of the climate and the area hit by forest fires, said Park Williams, one of the studys authors and a climate expert at Columbia University.
So he and lead study author John Abatzoglou of the University of Idaho decided to focus on how both dryness and total fire area have increased over the last few decades  and how much human-caused climate change, as opposed to just natural climate variations, has had to do with it.
The researchers examined eight different systems of measurement scientists commonly use to calculate the dryness of fuel in fire areas. Each one suggested that there have been significant increases in dryness between 1979 and 2015. The researchers also found there was a strong relationship between the increasing dryness and the area of land affected by forest fires. Overall, dryness accounted for more than three-quarters of the changes in burned area over the last three decades.
That allows us to basically say that climate has been the predominant driver of area burned in these western forests, Abatzoglou said.
The researchers then applied a climate model to investigate how big a hand human-causedclimate change has had in these changes, comparing what the fires look like when climate change is factored in versus what they look like when the effects of suchclimate changes are excluded.
Overall, the researchers found that anthropogenic climate change was responsible for just over half of the total observed increase in fuel dryness since 1979. In turn, this influence has added more than 16,000 square miles of forest fire area to the western United States since 1984  an area larger than the state of Maryland  nearly doubling the area scientists might have expected without the influence of similarclimate change.
The other half of these observed changes can be attributed to natural climate variations, the researchers say. For example, the past few decades have seen significant declines in spring precipitation out west  a change that scientists have partly attributed to a shift in a natural, large-scale ocean-atmosphere pattern known as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, which can cause long-term changes in ocean temperatures and global weather patterns.
Its this sort of compounding effect of natural climate variability aligning with climate change that has likely brought about this pretty significant increase weve seen in forest fire activity, Abatzoglou said.
That said, there are plenty of other factors that can affect the severity of fires besides just climate and dryness, even if these are likely the most dominant drivers. The abundance of vegetation in an area makes an obvious difference, Williams noted, as do events like lightning strikes and even some human fire management practices. Fire suppression tactics, for instance  preventing or snuffing out fires as much as possible  can lead to an overabundance of dry vegetation in some areas, increasing the likelihood of larger, more severe fires in the future.
But the big message is that climate is one of the biggest drivers of the recent increases in forest fires. And the effects are growing bigger and bigger over time, Williams noted.
The fact is that this relationship between fuel aridity and forest fire area is exponential, he said.That means that every degree of warming has a bigger impact on forest fire area than the previous degree of warming. That explains to me why every year we hear career-long firefighters saying theyve never seen fires burning the way that theyre burning.
And in the next few decades, the researchers believe we may see even bigger and more severe fires as the effects of climate change continue to grow.
Going forward in the next three to four decadesI expect fires to continue to become unrecognizable to previous generations, Williams said. In the 2030s, it is a very high likelihood that fires [will be] dwarfing the fires that we see today.
Past a certain point, its possible that so much burning will have taken place that there wont be enough fuel to continue feeding the flames, and so the fires will naturally begin to shrink down again, he added. But for decades at least, its likely that forest fires will continue to grow.
And thats a reality that communities in the western U.S. should start to prepare for, the researchers note. This includes setting up fire breaks around town, planning escape routes and investing in public education about healthy fire management techniques, like controlled burning.
One thing we all need to do is just get used to the idea that there are going to be continued increases in forest fire area, Williams said. And that means that towns that are situated in locations surrounded by forest need to make sure they are expecting a big fire to come through. A policy of hope is a really unwise one.

Exclusive: President Barack Obama Says, "This Is What a Feminist Looks Like"
But perhaps the greatest unexpected gift of this job has been living above the store. For many years my life was consumed by long commutesfrom my home in Chicago to Springfield, Illinois, as a state senator, and then to Washington, D.C., as a United States senator. Its often meant I had to work even harder to be the kind of husband and father I want to be.
That isnt always easy, eitherwatching them prepare to leave the nest. But one thing that makes me optimistic for them is that this is an extraordinary time to be a woman. The progress weve made in the past 100 years, 50 years, and, yes, even the past eight years has made life significantly better for my daughters than it was for my grandmothers. And I say that not just as President but also as a feminist.
In my lifetime weve gone from a job market that basically confined women to a handful of often poorly paid positions to a moment when women not only make up roughly half the workforce but are leading in every sector, from sports to space, from Hollywood to the Supreme Court. Ive witnessed how women have won the freedom to make your own choices about how youll live your livesabout your bodies, your educations, your careers, your finances. Gone are the days when you needed a husband to get a credit card. In fact, more women than ever, married or single, are financially independent.
So we shouldnt downplay how far weve come. That would do a disservice to all those who spent their lives fighting for justice. At the same time, theres still a lot of work we need to do to improve the prospects of women and girls here and around the world. And while Ill keep working on good policiesfrom equal pay for equal work to protecting reproductive rightsthere are some changes that have nothing to do with passing new laws.
This is something I spoke about at length in June at the first-ever White House Summit on the United State of Women. As far as weve come, all too often we are still boxed in by stereotypes about how men and women should behave. One of my heroines is Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, who was the first African American to run for a major partys presidential nomination. She once said, The emotional, sexual, and psychological stereotyping of females begins when the doctor says, Its a girl. We know that these stereotypes affect how girls see themselves starting at a very young age, making them feel that if they dont look or act a certain way, they are somehow less worthy. In fact, gender stereotypes affect all of us, regardless of our gender, gender identity, or sexual orientation.
Now, the most important people in my life have always been women. I was raised by a single mom, who spent much of her career working to empower women in developing countries. I watched as my grandmother, who helped raise me, worked her way up at a bank only to hit a glass ceiling. Ive seen how Michelle has balanced the demands of a busy career and raising a family. Like many working mothers, she worried about the expectations and judgments of how she should handle the trade-offs, knowing that few people would question my choices. And the reality was that when our girls were young, I was often away from home serving in the state legislature, while also juggling my teaching responsibilities as a law professor. I can look back now and see that, while I helped out, it was usually on my schedule and on my terms. The burden disproportionately and unfairly fell on Michelle.
So Id like to think that Ive been pretty aware of the unique challenges women faceits what has shaped my own feminism. But I also have to admit that when youre the father of two daughters, you become even more aware of how gender stereotypes pervade our society. You see the subtle and not-so-subtle social cues transmitted through culture. You feel the enormous pressure girls are under to look and behave and even think a certain way.
And those same stereotypes affected my own consciousness as a young man. Growing up without a dad, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out who I was, how the world perceived me, and what kind of man I wanted to be. Its easy to absorb all kinds of messages from society about masculinity and come to believe that theres a right way and a wrong way to be a man. But as I got older, I realized that my ideas about being a tough guy or cool guy just werent me. They were a manifestation of my youth and insecurity. Life became a lot easier when I simply started being myself.
So we need to break through these limitations. We need to keep changing the attitude that raises our girls to be demure and our boys to be assertive, that criticizes our daughters for speaking out and our sons for shedding a tear. We need to keep changing the attitude that punishes women for their sexuality and rewards men for theirs.
We need to keep changing a culture that shines a particularly unforgiving light on women and girls of color. Michelle has often spoken about this. Even after achieving success in her own right, she still held doubts; she had to worry about whether she looked the right way or was acting the right waywhether she was being too assertive or too angry.
As a parent, helping your kids to rise above these constraints is a constant learning process. Michelle and I have raised our daughters to speak up when they see a double standard or feel unfairly judged based on their gender or raceor when they notice that happening to someone else. Its important for them to see role models out in the world who climb to the highest levels of whatever field they choose. And yes, its important that their dad is a feminist, because now thats what they expect of all men.
The good news is that everywhere I go across the country, and around the world, I see people pushing back against dated assumptions about gender roles. From the young men whove joined our Its On Us campaign to end campus sexual assault, to the young women who became the first female Army Rangers in our nations history, your generation refuses to be bound by old ways of thinking. And youre helping all of us understand that forcing people to adhere to outmoded, rigid notions of identity isnt good for anybodymen, women, gay, straight, transgender, or otherwise. These stereotypes limit our ability to simply be ourselves.
This fall we enter a historic election. Two hundred and forty years after our nations founding, and almost a century after women finally won the right to vote, for the first time ever, a woman is a major political partys presidential nominee. No matter your political views, this is a historic moment for America. And its just one more example of how far women have come on the long journey toward equality.
I want all of our daughters and sons to see that this too is their inheritance. I want them to know that its never been just about the Benjamins; its about the Tubmans too. And I want them to help do their part to ensure that America is a place where every single child can make of her life what she will.
Weekly Address: Top 10 Things that Happened in 2015
Earth Kicks Off 2016 With the Most Abnormally Warm Month Ever Measured
It would be hard to top 2015a year unlike any other in human historybut 2016 seems to be giving it a shot.
According to the latest data from NASA, issued over the weekend, January was the planet's most unusually warm month since we started measuring temperature in 1880. No other month in the preceding 1,633 months has deviated this far from what was once considered normal. Data independently produced by Japans Meteorological Agency confirmed that last month was the hottest January on record globally. Last month broke the all-time January record by the widest margin of any month on record, a full one-third of a degree ahead of last years record pace. That means the planet is already on track for an unprecedented third straight year of record-setting temperatures.
Theres a single major reason that this global temperature spike is happening right now: The current El Nio is now officially the most intense ever measured, at least by the most common definition. But humans are also playing a major role, especially in the Arctic, where El Nios influence is limited.
Its not entirely known how much the buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide is affecting the natural El Nio phenomenon, but mega events like this years might be getting more frequent.
Last months impressive warmth was concentrated in the Arctic, where average temperatures were as much as 23 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. (Thats like New York City averaging 62 degrees every afternoon for the entire month of January.) Arctic sea ice is now at an all-time low for this time of year.
Nowhere on Earth are temperatures climbing faster and the consequences are profound: As ice melts, it reveals darker water, which more readily absorbs the suns energy, leading to more melting. In a particularly hard-hit spotthe Barents Sea, Kara Sea, and the East GreenlandSea north of Europe, where the abnormally warm Gulf Stream current terminatesthe base of the oceanic food chain is at risk as plankton numbers plummet. The resulting shift in weather patterns from the warmer water there may have also contributed to Januarys blockbuster blizzard on the East Coast.

President Obama on Science, Technology, and How to Win The Future
Barack Obama: Science and technology helped make America the greatest country on Earth. Whether its setting foot on the moon, developing a vaccine for polio, inventing the Internet, or building the worlds strongest military, weve relied on innovative scientists, technologists, engineers, and mathematicians to help us tackle the toughest challenges of our time.
   In my first inaugural address, I promised that my administration would restore science to its rightful place, and thats exactly what weve done. Weve expanded clean-energy research; weve launched major initiatives in advanced manufacturing, biomedicine, and strategic computing; weve increased preparedness and resilience against climate change; and were training STEM [science, technology, engineering, and math] teachers so every child grows up with the skills they need to compete in the 21st century. Being pro-science is the only way we make sure that America continues to lead the world. Our policies reflect that.
BO: Theres a lot to be proud of. We now graduate 25,000 more engineers per year from our colleges and universities than we did when I took office. Were more than halfway toward our goal of preparing 100,000 new math and science teachers by 2021. Weve secured more than $1 billion of private investment for improving STEM education, and commitments from college and university leadership to help underrepresented students earn STEM degrees. Theres also something thats harder to measure, but every bit as important: all the young people, including minorities and young women, who are more excited than ever about pursuing their passions for STEM. 
   One of the new traditions Ive started as president is the White House Science Fair. We ought to celebrate science fair winners at least as much as Super Bowl winners. And when young people are excited about science, technology, engineering, and math, thats not just good for them. Thats good for America. We want the next game-changing industry or life-saving breakthrough to happen right here in the United States.
BO: Well, my administration did write a pretty detailed response to a petition, explaining why we wouldnt build a real-life Death Star, so Id like to think I have at least a little nerd credibility built up. 
   Whats remarkable is the way "nerd" is such a badge of honor now. Growing up, Im sure I wasnt the only kid who read Spider-Man comics and learned how to do the Vulcan salute, but it wasnt like it is today. I get the sense that todays young people are proud to be smart and curious, to design new things, and tackle big problems in unexpected ways. I think Americas a nerdier country than it was when I was a kidand thats a good thing!
BO: Innovation and entrepreneurship are already happening all over the country. New technologies like cloud computing, big data, and 3-D printing are lowering barriers to entry. And you can now collaborate with partners around the country or across the world, practically at the speed of light. So no matter where you live, there has simply never been a better time to launch an idea and bring it to scale in America. 
   Of course, were working to make it even easier for entrepreneurs. No matter who you are, what you look like, or what ZIP code youre born into, if you work hard, you should have the chance to go as far as your talent takes you. Thats why our TechHire initiative, which works to place more Americans in well-paid tech jobs, has expanded to 35 cities, states, and counties. Its also why we hosted the first-ever Demo Day and Maker Faire at the White House. Im going to go out on a limb and say Im the first president to welcome a 17-foot-tall robotic giraffe onto his lawn. 
   Some of the most inspiring scientists, entrepreneurs, and inventors I meet are also some of the youngest. Elana Simon presented her work at one of our science fairs. At age 12, Elana survived a rare form of liver cancer. She teamed up with one of her surgeons to gather data about her disease from across the country and discovered a common genetic mutation across the samples she collectedall before graduating high school. Thats the kind of story we want to see more of, from every part of America. And I have no doubt that, thanks in part to our policies, we will.

A guide to writing a letter to the editor
Choose an issue you want to write about and take a look at some suggested topics to help you get started. Its just a starting point, thoughmake your letter personal to you and your community.
NASA and 97% of scientists agree that climate change is real. Is your representative a climate change denier? Do you live in a coastal area that has experienced more frequent and more devastating storms in recent years? Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods are all now more frequent and intense, and are projected to worsen in the future due to climate change. Has your community been impacted by extreme weather in recent years?
Help spread the word: This year's open enrollment period begins November 15th. Have you or someone you know recently received coverage in the health insurance marketplace? If so, explain why it's important to you that you and your loved ones have insurance. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, no one can be denied coverage ever again. Were you or someone you know previously denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition? Have you or someone you know recently visited a doctor for an annual checkup, vaccination, or mammogrampreventive care which is now free under Obamacare? Do you or someone you know have a child who can now benefit from staying on your health insurance until they turn 26, thanks to the new law? Under Obamacare, insurance companies can no longer set lifetime limits on your coverage. Do you or someone you know now benefit from this basic protection?
The impact of gun violence affects communities across the country every day. Has your community been affected by gun violence? Why is important to you that we close the loopholes in background checks to keep guns out of dangerous hands? 
 In 2013, a minority in the Senate blocked a common-sense, bipartisan bill that would've extended background checks for all gun sales, closing the dangerous loophole that allows guns to fall into the wrong hands. Despite their inaction, many states are taking action to expand background checks on their own. What should your state do to make progress to help prevent gun violence? Call on state leaders to act.
Despite support from both parties, the House of Representatives failed to act for over a year on a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate with a large bipartisan majority. President Obama took common-sense steps to fix our broken immigration system (learn more here). Why is this action important to you? The Presidents actions will grow the U.S. economy by $90 billion over the next 10 years, and protect our families and communities, focusing our law enforcement resources where they should be focused: on felons, not families. Do you know someone who will benefit from the President's actions to help fix our broken immigration system? A permanent comprehensive fix for our broken system can only come from Congress, but 11 presidents have acted 39 times to address immigration over the past 60 years. President Obama's common-sense steps fit into this long history of presidents using their authority to improve our immigration system. Why is it important to you to that Congress build on the President's actions and take steps to fix our broken system now?
According to the Economic Policy Institute, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would create 140,000 jobs and increase GDP by $33 billion. How would raising the minimum wage affect you and your family? In December 2013, Congress allowed unemployment insurance benefits to expire for 1.3 million workers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Each week that Congress fails to act, 72,000 more job seekers lose this crucial lifeline. Have you or someone you know lost unemployment insurance because of Congressional inaction?
Women working full-time make an average of only 77 cents for every dollar that a man makes. Have you or someone you know been impacted by this inequality? Almost 60% of minimum wage workers are women, and women are increasingly the primary breadwinners in American homes. Can you explain how an increase in minimum wage would help you or someone you know, or women and families generally? Only 51% of women have access to paid leave after having their first child. Can you explain why workplace policies that help women and familieslike paid family leaveare important to you? Approximately 40% of America's private-sector employees don't have access to sick leave to allow them to care for themselves, a sick parent or a sick child. Can you talk about your experience with sick leave and why it would be important to have a standard across workplaces?

Summer-on-Steroids Kicks Off With Record Global Temperatures
Last month wasnt just the hottest June on recordit continued the longest-ever streak of record-breaking months: 14.
The start of summer in the Northern Hemisphere gave usthehottest June since 1880,according to data released Tuesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). That follows the hottest May,April, March, February, January, December, November, October, September, August, and July. Before June 2016, June 2015 held the monthly record, as did May 2015.
Last years massiveEl Nio warming pattern in the Pacific Ocean is over, but unprecedented heat remains across the planet.The extremes of recent months are such that were onlyhalfway into 2016 and theres already a greater than 99 percent likelihood that this year will be the hottest on record, according to Gavin Schmidt,whodirects NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies. NASA and NOAA maintain independent records of the Earths temperatures, but they both agree that last month was a scorcher.

This contest is now closed.
The world just took another huge step forward on fighting climate change
This story has been updated.
Last week, we learned that the Paris climate agreement will go into effectin November after the European Union formally joined the accord, tipping it past the threshold needed tobecome a reality.
Now this week brings another major foray in international climate diplomacy, as close to200 countriesadopted an amendment tothe 1987 Montreal Protocol to phase down the use ofhydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which are super-polluting, powerful greenhouse gases.
The prospects for the future of our planet are bright, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy said in a statement about the deal. McCarthy led aU.S. delegation to Kigali, Rwanda, where the deal was struck early Saturday after negotiations that ran through the night.
President Obama also hailed the accord in a statement Saturday morning. Todays agreement caps off a critical ten days in our global efforts to combat climate change, he said. In addition to todays amendment, countries last week crossed the threshold for the Paris Agreement to enter into force and reached a deal to constrain international aviation emissions. Together, these steps show that, while diplomacy is never easy, we can work together to leave our children a planet that is safer, more prosperous, more secure, and more free than the one that was left for us.
HFCs dont get muchattention. But heres why they matter: When the original Montreal Protocol phased out chlorofluorocarbons, which were destroying the planets ozone layer, manufacturers had to find a replacement chemical to use as refrigerants and in other industrial applications.
Along came HFCs, which were much better for the ozone layer but, like CFCs, also happen to bea strongglobal warming agent. The chemicalsarevastly more powerful than carbon dioxide over a 100 year time frame when it comes to warming the atmosphere. So one huge environmental crisis was, in effect, replaced byanother problem lingering on the horizon.
Scientists fear that aforecast explosion in air conditioning all around the world,especially in developing economies like India, could result in so much HFC leakage that it could warm the global temperature byan additional half a degree Celsiusby the end of the century, which would blow past warming thresholds outlined in the Paris agreement. Unless, that is, HFCs are curbed.
[The world is about to install 700 million air conditioners. Heres what that means for the climate]
Under theKigali Amendment approved early Saturday, the planned reduction of HFCs would have an impact similarto the removal of 80 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over the next 35 years, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.
U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who was also on hand for the negotiations said in a speech Friday that it is not often you get a chance to have a .5-degree centigrade reduction by taking one single step together as countries  each doing different things perhaps at different times, but getting the job done.
Paul Bledsoe, who worked on climate issues under President Bill Clinton in the 1990s and was in Kigali for the negotiations, said the agreement could help lessen climate change impacts like sea-level rise, wildfires, and extreme storms and floods. In addition,it should jump-start other efforts to get to prevent runaway climate change, he said.
The way the new amendment works is this: Developed and developing countries will have different freeze dates, or years when they must peak their HFC emissions and then begin to bring them down steadily over time. And in many cases, those freeze dates will be quite soon. For developed nations like the United States, the date will be 2019. For the majority of developing nations, it will be 2024, except for a few nations, including India and Pakistan, which will take a little longer, until 2028.
Some observers said that last development is a bit of a speed bump but not a very serious one. We came to take a half a degree Celsius out of future warming, and we won about 90 percent of our climate prize, said Durwood Zaelke, the head of theInstitute for Governance & Sustainable Development.
[Were placing far too much hope in pulling carbon dioxide out of the air, scientists warn]
But this HFC phase-down wont justhappen by international fiat. Zaelke said economic forces will now kick in to push manufacturers away from using HFCs and toward drawing on different chemicals. And that could make up the difference.
Every time weve done a past phase out, [the Protocol] has exceeded the dates, because the market moves faster, said Zaelke, who also spoke from Kigali. The market knows how to read these signals very well and the smart money has been moving [to] the climate friendly substitutes. Thats been underway, and this is the accelerant, and also the lock-in.
One major industry group, the U.S.-basedAir-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, hailed the agreement Friday, and signaled that the quest for alternatives is on.The agreement is just the first step in a multistep process,said the groups president, StephenYurek, in a statement. Our industry is hard at work doing the research on the HFC alternatives that will be used in the worlds air conditioners, heat pumps, and refrigeration equipment, and getting that right is certainly as important as reaching agreement.
The upshot is that on November 7, when nations of the world gather in Marrakesh, Morocco, for a key United Nations climate meeting, they will not only have the Paris agreement in force far earlier than anyone initially expected, but will also be operating with a new HFC regime. All of which marks 2016 as quite the year for international climate progress.

Antarctic loss could double expected sea level rise by 2100, scientists say
This story has been updated.
Sea levels could rise nearly twice as much as previously predicted by the end of this centuryifcarbon dioxideemissions continue unabated, an outcome that could devastate coastal communities around the globe,according to new research published Wednesday.
Scientists behind a new study published in the journal Nature used sophisticated computer models to decipher alongstanding riddleabout how the massive, mostly uninhabitedcontinent surrendered so much ice during previous warm periods on Earth.They found thatsimilar conditions in the future could lead to monumental and irreversible increases in sea levels. If high levels ofgreenhouse gas emissions continue, they concluded, oceans could rise byclose to two meters in total (more than six feet)bythe end of the century. The melting of ice on Antarctica alone could cause seas to rise more than 15 meters (49 feet) by 2500.
The startling findingspaint a far grimmer picture than current consensuspredictions, which havesuggested that seas could rise by just undera meter at most by the year 2100. Those estimates relied on the notion that expanding ocean waters and the melting of relatively small glaciers would fuel the majority ofsea level rise, rather than the massive ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica.
[The alarming science driving much higher sea level projections for this century]
The projection nearly doubles prior estimates of sea level rise, which had relied on a minimal contribution from Antarctica, said Rob DeConto ofUniversity of Massachusetts, Amherst, who authored the study with David Pollard of Penn State University.
The research already has created a buzz in the community of scientists studying Antarctica, and experts largely praised the new model as thorough and impressive, while noting its remaining uncertainties.
People should not look at this as a futuristic scenario of things that may or may not happen. They should look at it as the tragic story we are following right now, said Eric Rignot, an expert on Antarcticas ice sheet and anearth sciences professor at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in Wednesdays study. We are not there yet  [But] with the current rate of emissions, we are heading that way.
Should the new research prove correct,it could trigger a tectonic shift in expectations for the speed and severity of the sea levelproblem, said Ben Strauss, director of the program on sea level rise at Climate Central, an independent organization of scientists based in New Jersey. He said that while the studys findings represent potentiallygrave problems for many coastal areas in the decades ahead, the century beginning in 2100 could see truly catastrophic shifts, unless societies make sharp cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.
Under the high emissions scenario, the 22nd century would be the century of hell, Strauss said. There would really be an unthinkable level of sea rise. It would erase many major cities and some nations from the map  That century would become the century of exodus from the coast.
[Scientists say Antarctic melting could double sea level rise. Heres what that looks like]
Places as far flung as South Florida, Bangladesh, Shanghai, Hampton Roads in Virginia and parts of Washington, D.C., could be engulfed by rising waters, Strauss said. Even by 2100, Miami Beach and the Florida Keys could begin to vanish. New Orleans essentially could become an island guarded by levies. Floods that pushedas far inland as the surge from Hurricane Sandy could ravage parts of the East Coast with far greater frequency.
The researchers behind Wednesdays study make clear that their model has limitations and that human behavior can alter the possible outcomes. For instance, the worst-case scenario  ofseas rising nearly 4 feet due to Antarctic ice loss alone by 2100  assumes that very high emissions continue for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
In Paris late last year, world leaders forged an historic agreement to begin scaling back such emissions in coming years.They embraced the goal of holding global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, but at the same time, it has been widely noted that current country-level commitments to cut emissions fall far short of this target.
But even undera more moderate emissions scenario, Wednesdays study found that the Antarctic contribution to sea level rise still could reach about two feet by 2100, and muchmore by 2500. Only if countries sharply reduce emissions does the model show that its possible to preserve Antarctica in roughly its current state.
This research highlights the importance of doing even much better than the Paris agreement if were going to save our coastal cities, Strauss said.
DeConto and Pollard arrived at their projections about future sea level rise by first turning to the past.Their study is based on an improved understanding of two past warm eras in Earths history that featured much higher seas, known as the Pliocene and the Eemian.The Pliocene was a warm period about 3 million years ago, when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are believed to have been about what they are now  400 parts per million. Sea levels are believed to have been significantly higher than now  perhaps 30 feet or more. The Eemian period,between 130,000 and 115,000 years ago, also featured sea levels 6 to 9 meters above current levels, with global temperatures not much warmer than our current era.
[Why some Antarctic glaciers are disappearing faster then we thought]
Sea level rise on the scale seen in those eras likelyrequired a loss of ice not just from Greenland, but also from Antarctica. But previous computer models of Antarctica have failed to accurately reproduce such scenarios.Scientists had spent years of struggling to be able to simulate tens of meters of sea level rise in the Pliocene, DeConto said.This has been a longstanding problem for us. And we had known for years that were probably missing some important underlying physics.
Scientists already knew that key parts of Antarctica, and especially West Antarctica, feature a condition called marine ice sheet instability. That is, vast glaciers are already rooted below sea level and lie on downward sloping seabeds. Warm water can not only melt them from below, but as the glaciers retreat, more and more ice will be exposed to melting.
The new study factors innot only this process, but two new ice processesthat have scientists already haveseen destabilize severalglaciers in Greenland: hydrofracture, in which water formed by the melting of snow and iceatop a glaciers stabilizing ice shelfcausesit to break up; and cliff collapse, in which a sheer ice cliff 100 meters or more above sea level becomes unstable and crashes repeatedlyinto the ocean below. Both phenomena canspeed up the pace of ice loss from glaciers and cause sea level rise.
Build a little sand castle and it is fine; too high and it may break,said Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Penn State University who has published previouslywith DeConto and Pollard, describing therevelations regarding ice cliff collapse.
Knut Christianson, a glaciologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, said the new work will spur additional research to determine precisely what happens at glaciers where cliff collapses and so-called calving occur.Its a more comprehensive analysis than before, and it certainly indicates that we should look more closely to see whether or not the way they treat these processes in the model is accurate in the real world, he said.
The research further undermines a string of sea level projections from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which have been faulted for being too conservative.
In 2013, the body projected that for the same high-end emissions scenario used in the current study, sea level rise by the year 2100 would be between 0.52 and 0.98 meters (1.7 and 3.22 feet), relatively little of which would come from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. It notedthat beyond this likely range, only Antarcticas marine-based regions could conceivably contribute a lot more, but the panel found thatthere is medium confidence that this additional contribution would not exceed several tenths of a meter.
The new study challengesthat reasoning. It also emerges as mounting research has pointed at one region of Antarctica in particular  the Amundsen Sea sector of remote West Antarctica, centered on the enormous,marine-based Thwaites glacier as particularly vulnerable.
If the projections in Wednesdays study prove correct, they could present especially bad news forU.S. coasts. The reason is gravity:Antarcticas enormous mass pulls the ocean toward it, and when it loses significant mass, seas would surge back toward the opposite end of the world.
Sea level rise is not going to be felt evenly over the surface of the Earth. Its really bad for New York, Boston. We are sort of in the bullseye, DeConto said.

This weekend we learned of the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. While we didn't always agree with his rulings, we recognize the passion he held for the law, and his dedication to the institution of the Court.But now the Supreme Court only has eight members, even as it is about to consider some of the most important issues facing our countryfrom climate change and immigration reform, to women's and workers' rights.Shockingly, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's first reaction to this news was to say that the Senate should refuse to do its constitutional duty, and block President Obama from filling the vacancy.Friend, the Senate has a responsibility to fairly consider the President's nomination for the court, and we need to make sure they get the message.Let's be clear about what the Constitution says about this: When there's a vacancy on the Supreme Court, the President is required to nominate someone to fill it, and the Senate must give that nominee fair consideration.Anyone who says otherwise is putting politics first. The longest time a Supreme Court nominee has ever had to wait to get a vote was 125 days, and President Obama has more than 300 days remaining in his term.The Supreme Court is too important to be held hostage by partisan gridlock.

President Obama Addresses the 71st United Nations General Assembly  The White House
This morning, President Obama is addressing the United Nations General Assembly for his last time as president. If you dont know what UNGA is, youre not the only one.
But President Obama has come to UNGA every year in his Administration to outline his approach to American foreign policy and what global challenges he hoped to address together with the world leaders gathered there.
When the President first stood at the podium in the UN hall seven years ago, he reflected on what the world expected of American leadership on the global stage:
Since that day in September 2009, weve seen what that belief in the role the United States can play in delivering progress can bring about. The end of two wars in the Middle East. A historic nuclear agreement that will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. A global agreement to combat climate change. A normalization of relations with Cuba, Burma, and Laos. An advance of relations with Vietnam. A global coalition to degrade and defeat ISIL. The death of Osama bin Laden. The largest investment by any nation to put an AIDS-free generation well within reachand much more.
The President has refocused and reaffirmed American leadership in the world, recognizing that American strength derives not only from our military power but also our economic vitality, the depth and breadth of our global partnerships, and our values. In doing so, the President has remained relentless in taking action against terrorist networks, while also focusing on key emerging regions and policies that will shape the 21st century.
Take a look back at some key moments from the Presidents addresses to UNGA over the years, and tune in today at 10am ET to watch his last.
Exclusive: Obama on Threats to Nature, Power of National Parks
Strolling through a forested stretch of Yosemites lush valley, below towering granite cliffs and North America's tallest waterfall, the president spoke wistfully about how parks can inspire young minds, bring families together and be a reminder of the need to respond to climate change. The Hawaii-born president recounted one of his favorite childhood memoriesa trip to the mainland with his mother and grandmother when he was 11 that included a trip to Yellowstone National Parkand said he was envious of nature-lover Teddy Roosevelt, who frequently disappeared into the woods during his presidency more than a century ago, and became a leader in protecting Americas wild places.
One of the things that binds us together is we only have one planet and climate change is probably the biggest threat  not only to natural wonders like thisbut to the well-being of billions of people, coastal cities, agricultural communities that can be displaced in the span of a few decades by changes in temperatures that mean more drought, more wildfires, said Obama, who was one of the driving forces behind a new international agreement that seeks to curb the growth of greenhouse gas emissions.
"I think that the way a place like this imprints itself in you, especially when youre young, and carries on for the rest of your life, is remarkable," Obama told Bacon. I do believe that when we get kids, families, out in open spaces, it changes them. It roots you. It gives you a sense that there's something bigger and grander than you. It gives you a sense of order.
Two days after visiting Orlando in the wake of the nations worst mass-shooting, the president took his own family to Yosemite this weekend, in part to draw attention to a summer-long celebration of the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service. Obama hiked with Bacon through forests of black oak and ponderosa pine, in a region that first ignited the passions of naturalist John Muir, one of the nations most forceful voices for preservation. The president took in some of the iconic vistas that National Geographic magazine's first fulltime editor, Gilbert Grosvenor, urged Congress to protect as part of a 1916 campaign that helped create the Park Service.
Obama also joked that hes noticed when he visits national parks that rangers, in particular, are a happy bunch. And he bemoaned how much more difficult it is for him than for Roosevelt to slip away into the wild, but agreed with Roosevelts assessment that places like Yosemite are sacred cathedrals.
Bacon's full interview with the president will air as part of National Geographic Channels special programming on the parks, which begins August 23. Two days later, August 25, will mark the centennial of President Woodrow Wilson's signing of the Organic Act, which created the Park Service. National Geographic, Facebook and its Oculus team, and Felix & Paul Studios also shot the White House's first 360 virtual reality video experience, capturing the president's Yosemite visit. That also will air in August.
Obama's Father's Day weekend began Friday with a trip to Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, where he, First Lady Michelle Obama and their daughters Malia and Sasha toured a massive section of cave called the Big Room. After landing Friday night in breathtaking fashion in Yosemitedropping into a valley meadow at dusk in Marine One as the setting sun glinted off the ancient granite of Half Dome  the president and Michelle Obama on Saturday morning surprised a group of 4th-grade students who were visiting Yosemite as part of a White House program that offers free access to national parks for 4th graders and their families.
There Is Such a Thing as Being Too Late
The idea that these iconic places could be marred or lost to history shouldnt be treated as a hoaxit should spur us to action, Obama said. It shouldnt lead to careless suggestions that we might scrap the most advanced climate treaty the world has ever signedit should make us set our sights even higher, and more ambitious.
In part as a buffer against changes in nature, Obama is increasingly talking about land and water preservation. A White House Facebook video this week ticked through a list of land monuments and marine areas the president has protected by using the Antiquities Act. On Saturday, he declared that his administration had conserved some 265 million acres  "more land and water than any president in history."
Barack Obama: Now Is the Greatest Time to Be Alive
When WIRED asked me to guest-edit the November issue, I didnt hesitate. I know its the height of election season, and I happen to have a day job that keeps me pretty busy. But given the chance to immerse myself in the possibility of interplanetary travel or join a deep-dive conversation on artificial intelligence, Im going to say yes. I love this stuff. Always have. Its why my favorite movie of last year was TheMartian. Of course, Im predisposed to love any movie where Americans defy the odds and inspire the world. But what really grabbed me about the film is that it shows how humansthrough our ingenuity, our commitment to fact and reason, and ultimately our faith in each othercan science the heck out of just about any problem.
Im a guy who grew up watching Star Trekand Id be lying if I said that show didnt have at least some small influence on my worldview. What I loved about it was its optimism, the fundamental belief at its core that the people on this planet, for all our varied backgrounds and outward differences, could come together to build a better tomorrow.
I still believe that. I believe we can work together to do big things that raise the fortunes of people here at home and all over the world. And even if weve got some work left to do on faster-than-light travel, I still believe science and technology is the warp drive that accelerates that kind of change for everybody.
Heres another thing I believe: We are far better equipped to take on the challenges we face than ever before. I know that might sound at odds with what we see and hear these days in the cacophony of cable news and social media. But the next time youre bombarded with over-the-top claims about how our country is doomed or the world is coming apart at the seams, brush off the cynics and fearmongers. Because the truth is, if you had to choose any time in the course of human history to be alive, youd choose this one. Right here in America, right now.
Lets start with the big picture. By almost every measure, this country is better, and the world is better, than it was 50 years ago, 30 years ago, or even eight years ago. Leave aside the sepia tones of the 1950s, a time when women, minorities, and people with disabilities were shut out of huge parts of American life. Just since 1983, when I finished college, things like crime rates, teen pregnancy rates, and poverty rates are all down. Life expectancy is up. The share of Americans with a college education is up too. Tens of millions of Americans recently gained the security of health insurance. Blacks and Latinos have risen up the ranks to lead our businesses and communities. Women are a larger part of our workforce and are earning more money. Once-quiet factories are alive again, with assembly lines churning out the components of a clean-energy age.
And just as America has gotten better, so has the world. More countries know democracy. More kids are going to school. A smaller share of humans know chronic hunger or live in extreme poverty. In nearly two dozen countriesincluding our ownpeople now have the freedom to marry whomever they love. And last year the nations of the world joined together to forge the most comprehensive agreement to battle climate change in human history.
This kind of progress hasnt happened on its own. It happened because people organized and voted for better prospects; because leaders enacted smart, forward-looking policies; because peoples perspectives opened up, and with them, societies did too. But this progress also happened because we scienced the heck out of our challenges. Science is how we were able to combat acid rain and the AIDS epidemic. Technology is what allowed us to communicate across oceans and empathize with one another when a wall came down in Berlin or a TV personality came out. Without Norman Borlaugs wheat, we could not feed the worlds hungry. Without Grace Hoppers code, we might still be analyzing data with pencil and paper.
Thats one reason why Im so optimistic about the future: the constant churn of scientific progress. Think about the changes weve seen just during my presidency. When I came into office, I broke new ground by pecking away at a BlackBerry. Today I read my briefings on an iPad and explore national parks through a virtual-reality headset. Who knows what kind of changes are in store for our next president and the ones who follow?
Thats why I centered this issue on the idea of frontiersstories and ideas about whats over the next horizon, about what lies on the other side of the barriers we havent broken through yet. I wanted to explore how we get past where we are today to build a world thats even better for us allas individuals, as communities, as a country, and as a planet.
Because the truth is, while weve made great progress, theres no shortage of challenges ahead: Climate change. Economic inequality. Cybersecurity. Terrorism and gun violence. Cancer, Alzheimers, and antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Just as in the past, to clear these hurdles weregoing to need everyonepolicy makers and community leaders, teachers and workers and grassroots activists, presidents and soon-to-be-former presidents. And to accelerate that change, we need science. We need researchers and academics and engineers; programmers, surgeons, and botanists. And most important, we need not only the folks at MIT or Stanford or the NIH but also the mom in West Virginia tinkering with a 3-D printer, the girl on the South Side of Chicago learning to code, the dreamer in San Antonio seeking investors for his new app, the dad in North Dakota learning new skills so he can help lead the green revolution.
Thats how we will overcome the challenges we face: by unleashing the power of all of us for all of us. Not just for those of us who are fortunate, but for everybody. That means creating not just a quicker way to deliver takeout downtown but also a system that distributes excess produce to communities where too many kids go to bed hungry. Not just inventing a service that fills your car with gas but also creating cars that dont need fossil fuels at all. Not just making our social networks more fun for sharing memes but also harnessing their power to counter terrorist ideologies and online hate speech.
The point is, we need todays big thinkers thinking big. Think like you did when you were watching Star Trek or Star Wars or Inspector Gadget. Think like the kids I meet every year at the White House Science Fair. We started this event in 2010 with a simple premise: We need to teach our kids that its not just the winner of the Super Bowl who deserves to be celebrated but the winner of the science fair. Since then, Ive met young people who are tackling everything from destroying cancer cells to using algae to produce clean energy to distributing vaccines to remote areas of the worldall before most of them can even vote.
And as I meet with these young people, I cant help but wonder what might be nextwhat might happen at a White House Science Fair in five years or 20 years or 50 years? I imagine a student who grows an artificial pancreas right in front of the presidentan idea that eventually eliminates waiting lists for lifesaving organs. I imagine the girls who discover a new fuel based on only sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide; the teenager who makes voting and civic activism as addictive as scrolling through your Twitter feed; the boy from Idaho who grows potatoes from a plot of soil brought back from our colony on Mars. And I imagine some future president strolling out on the South Lawn with a student who invented a new kind of telescope. As the president looks through the lens, the girl turns the telescope to a planet she just discovered, orbiting a faraway star at the very edge of our galaxy. Then she says shes hard at work on another inventionone that will take us there someday.
These kinds of moments are closer than you think. My hope is that these kidsmaybe some of your kids or grandkidswill be even more curious and creative and confident than we are today. But that depends on us. We must continue to nurture our childrens curiosity. We must keep funding scientific, technological, and medical research. And above all, we must embrace that quintessentially American compulsion to race for new frontiers and push the boundaries of whats possible. If we do, Im hopeful that tomorrows Americans will be able to look back at what we didthe diseases we conquered, the social problems we solved, the planet we protected for themand when they see all that, theyll plainly see that theirs is the best time to be alive. And then theyll take a page from our book and write the next great chapter in our American story, emboldened to keep going where no one has gone before.

12.7 million signed up for Obama health care law, beating expectations
WASHINGTON  Still facing political jeopardy, President Barack Obamas health care law beat expectations by earning solid sign-ups this year, according to figures released Thursday by the administration.
About 12.7 million people signed up for individual private insurance policies or renewed their coverage for 2016, said Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell. That means Republicans running in this years elections may find it harder to deliver on their promise of repeal, while Democrats may yet be able to tap the newly insured as a voting constituency.
The health care law is helping millions of people and has become an important part of health care in America, Burwell said. The coverage is a product people do want and need.
Expectations were low at the start of open enrollment on Nov. 1. Premiums have been going up, and many of the remaining uninsured are considered skeptics.
The 12.7 million number falls right in the middle of the administrations projection of 11 million to 14 million initial enrollments through HealthCare.gov and state-run counterparts. The administration says this years initial numbers are more accurate because early cancellations have been winnowed out.
But enrollment tends to dwindle as the year goes on. Some people leave for employer coverage while other customers cant keep up with the costs, even while receiving considerable financial help. Others run into problems with the laws complicated paperwork and lose their subsidies.
Burwell has set customer retention as the ultimate goal. Her target is 10 million consumers still signed up and paying premiums at the end of the year. With a cushion at the start, the administration seems on track to reach that goal in Obamas final year in office.
This year was the third sign-up season for the Affordable Care Act, and different challenges emerged. The problem wasnt the HealthCare.gov website, which is faster, more reliable and easier to use. The issues had to do with the cost of coverage, the motivations of millions of people who remain uninsured, and the sometimes mind-boggling complexity of the system created by Obamas signature law.
Premiums went up for the private, taxpayer-subsidized coverage sold through HealthCare.gov and state insurance markets. Many of the more than 10 million eligible uninsured Americans tended to be younger people on tight budgets, with rent, education loans and car payments to juggle.
The 2016 enrollment number surpassed last years mark of nearly 11.7 million sign-ups.
Some insurers say customers appeared to be better informed and more engaged this year. Instead of a big spike on the Jan. 31 sign-up deadline, insurers say they saw steady traffic throughout last week.
Some procrastinators may have been swayed by a sharp increase in fines on those who remain uninsured. For 2016, the penalty will rise to $695 or 2.5 percent of taxable income, whichever is higher. The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates the average 2016 penalty at $969 per uninsured household.
Exemptions from the penalty are available for low income and other extenuating circumstances, but the administration says there will be no second chance to enroll for people who learn about the penalty when they file their taxes.
The health law has added coverage in two major ways: Online insurance markets like HealthCare.gov offer subsidized private plans to people who dont have coverage on the job, and states have the option of a Medicaid expansion aimed at low-income adults. Thirty-one states, plus Washington, D.C., have expanded their Medicaid programs.
More than 14 percent of Americans were uninsured in 2013 before the health care laws big coverage expansion. That share dropped to 9 percent last year, according to the government. More than 16 million people gained coverage from the end of 2013 to the middle of last year. But a recently major independent survey suggests those historic gains could be slowing.
Republicans remain committed to repealing Obamacare, and every GOP presidential candidate has vowed to deliver on that promise.
Among the Democratic contenders, Hillary Clinton would make changes geared to improving the health care law, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would incorporate all current health programs into a new government-run system that would also absorb employer-provided and individually purchased insurance.
Polls show the public remains divided over the health care law.

Big Corporations Are Using a Record Amount of Clean Energy
On November 30, world leaders will flock to Paris to hammer out an international agreement to slow global warming. The agreement is likely to give a boost to the clean energy industry, as countries around the world pour money into wind and solar projects as a way to cut their greenhouse gas footprints.
In the United States clean energy is already a booming business. Solar is the fastest-growing energy source in the country, and in 2015 total investment in renewable energy projects here reached nearly $40 billion. Here's some more good news: Big corporations are signing up for a record amount of clean energy for their offices, data centers, warehouses, and other facilities, according to a new analysis by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit environmental research outfit.
"This trend is going to be difficult to stop," says Herv Touati of the Rocky Mountain Institute.
RMI tracked publicly announced contracts between corporations and large-scale wind and solar farms and found that in 2015 the total reached 2,100 megawatts, roughly equal to 525,000 home rooftop solar systems. That's 75 percent higher than what RMI measured last year, and it includes more than a dozen companies with new contracts. New contracts this year include Dow Chemical, General Motors, Walmart, and Kaiser Permanente. It's also a big win for the climate: Electricity accounts for one-third of US greenhouse gas emissions, and more than one-third of electricity goes to commercial users. So if big companies are clamoring for clean energy, that can have a significant, near-term impact on reducing the nation's greenhouse gas footprint.
"The pressure is mounting [for corporate executives] to take action" on climate change, said Herv Touati, RMI's managing director. "What they realize is that signing these large deals is the best way to say you are addressing your sustainability agenda."
In most cases, the contracts are "power purchase agreements," where the company agrees to buy a certain amount of power from a wind or solar farm at a fixed price for 10 to 20 years. These contracts are mutually beneficial, Touati explained: They give renewable energy developers the guaranteed revenue they need to finance big new projects, and give the companies long-term certainty about one of their biggest expenses, electricity.
Tech companies such as Google and Facebook were early adopters of large-scale clean energy, thanks to the sky-high electricity consumption at data centers. Last year, Apple announced that 94 percent of its operations are powered by clean energy, including a massive solar array outside its data center in North Carolina. Now, Touati said, a more diverse mix of corporations is getting in on the act, including hospitals, hotels, and shipping companies.
That trend is driven by a confluence of factors that have made clean energy contracts seem like low-hanging fruit to top corporate financial officers. The cost of clean energy is continuing to plummetsolar power could soon be cheaper than conventional grid electricity in all 50 states. Meanwhile, customers and investors are increasingly conscientious about companies' impact on the environment. A recent survey by the World Resources Institute found that half of all Fortune 500 companies have implemented specific goals to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and invest in renewables.
The only losers in this arrangement, Touati said, are traditional electric utilities, which more cling to fossil fuel-fired power plants. For those power companies, the loss of big corporate customers is harder to brush off than losing a few homes to rooftop solar. That could motivate them to clean up their act more quickly.
"When we come with Google and Facebook and those big names and we tell [electric utilities] that these big corporations want this, then they start to listen," he said. "This trend is going to be difficult to stop."
We must recommit to national parks, Americas cathedrals
In 1914, Stephen Mather, a wealthy director of a borax mining company in California, observed the deteriorating conditions of some of Americas national parks and wrote a letter of protest to Interior Secretary Franklin Lane. Lane responded: Dear Steve, if you dont like the way the parks are being run, come on down to Washington and run them yourself. Such challenges have launched many political careers in Washington, including my own. I started in the National Park Service during the nations bicentennial in 1976, and a similar call brought me to Washington in 2009 to lead the agency through its centennial this year.
One hundred years ago Thursday, on Aug. 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the act creating the National Park Service  with Mather as its first director. The Organic Act states that the fundamental purpose of the NPS is to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.
For the past century, the National Park Service has been providing for the enjoyment of our most beautiful, treasured and historic places, put into our stewardship by Congress and both Democratic and Republican presidents. A large number of NPS employees join the service for life, because this work is more than a career; it is a mission. That mission is unlike that of any other federal agency: We serve as keepers of the nations cultural memory.
The 413 units of the national park system are a collective expression of who we are as a people, and in the words of historian John Hope Franklin, the public looks upon national parks almost as a metaphor for America itself. The parks deliver messages to current and future generations about the foundational experiences that have made the United States a symbol of democracys greatest achievements for the rest of the world. The Obama administration has worked to ensure that the parks tell the story of the United States cultural history. Among the 22 sites that President Obama has added to the national park system are places that will ensure that the memories of Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman, Col.Charles Young and the Buffalo Soldiers, and Csar Chvez endure.
One of our newest sites, the Stonewall National Monument in New York, will memorialize the struggles that the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community has faced over the years, along with one of its major victories.
But the National Park Services enabling legislation requires that these places and ideas are not just preserved but enjoyed. This leads me to believe that we are the only federal agency with a mandate to ensure that the American people have some fun.
In 1956, when planning for our 50thanniversary, the National Park Service invited World War II veterans to come and see what they had fought for. In partnership with the growing automobile industry, the service invited them to See the USA in your Chevrolet. Veterans came out in droves with their children in the back seats of their station wagons, and from those experiences grew a groundswell of support for conservation and historic preservation. Those children today are the baby boomers, now with millennial children and grandchildren.
For our 100th anniversary, in partnership with the National Park Foundation, we invited everyone to Find Your Park, to foster the creation of a new generation of park visitors, supporters and advocates reflecting the diversity of our nation. The result of this effort has been record-setting visitation and a surge of sharing on social media about extraordinary park experiences.
But this anniversary is much more than a celebration. It also calls for introspection and a forward-looking vision recommitting to the ideals and aspirations that bind us as a nation and to the institution tasked with their stewardship  the National Park Service.
Filmmaker Ken Burns said that national parks are the Declaration of Independence applied to the land. Regardless of ethnicity, social status or level of wealth, Americans appreciate the beauty of grand landscapes. Our national parks provide the opportunity for all to experience that beauty as equals.
It is pretty hard to not feel a wash of pride for our country when you stand at the rim of the Grand Canyon National Park, in the alpine glow of Grand Teton National Park, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial or on the bloodstained fields of Gettysburg National Military Park. These are our American cathedrals, and they belong to you. Come and enjoy them and refresh your memory of what it means to be an American.

Merrick Garland Deserves a Hearing
There are at least two criteria on which to judge President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court. First are his qualifications. Second is the ideological space that he would occupy on a polarized court in a polarized political environment.
Garland is a superb choice on both counts.
Garland's experience -- while not quite as nontraditional as Obama indicated he wanted in his nominee -- would serve the court well. A two-decade veteran of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where he is chief judge, Garland also worked in the criminal division of the Justice Department, where he led the prosecution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. He has also beena partner at a large corporate law firm and, like Chief Justice John Roberts, was a clerk early in his career for the legendary late Judge Henry Friendly.
On the D.C. Circuit, his opinions have been notable for their measured tone and failure to inspire controversy -- though it should be noted that the court's caseload is heavily oriented toward regulatory conflicts and other legal skirmishes involving federal power. Such cases are undeniably important and can be ideologically divisive, but they are less politically charged than those that reach the Supreme Court involving abortion, gay rights and other social conflicts.
In nominating a 63-year-old judicial moderate, Obama took the opposite tack desired by his party's most eager partisans: He is betting that Garland's career and ideological disposition simply lack the stuff of election-year passions.
The president is probably wrong about that. About an hour after Obama announced Garland's nomination, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reiterated that the Senate would simply treat the president's nomination as if it didn't exist. It was a hard argument to make even when it didn't actually exist -- and it's even more absurd now that there is a flesh-and-blood nominee to consider.
McConnell and his colleagues are free to reject Garland after holding hearings and taking a vote. The Senate has theright to provide advice and consent, but not the duty.
The political wisdom of refusing even to consider Garland, however, is another matter. The Senate voted 76 to 23 to confirm him 19 years ago, and his reputation has only grown since; just last week, Senator Orrin Hatch called Garland a "fine man" but doubted Obama would ever nominate him. Hatch was taken by surprise. Now it's time for Senate Republicans to give Merrick Garland the serious consideration he deserves.

Watch clean energy costs fall, in one chart
The Department of Energy just released Revolution Now, an annual update on its progress in accelerating clean energy. Specifically, it focuses on advances in five technologies: wind power, utility-scale solar power, distributed solar power, electric vehicles, and LEDs.
DOE has also reduced the report to a "six charts" post. However, we here at Vox understand that you, the modern media consumer, are a busy person, with many intriguing Facebook links to click while you pretend to work. You dont have time to go scrolling and wading through six whole graphs like youre on holiday or something.
Have no fear. I have taken the report, with all its tedious numbers and facts, and selected from it a single graph that tells you Everything You Need to Know*.
Here it is:
Since Obama entered office, these key technologies have dropped in cost between 41 and 94 percent.
Innovation in clean technology has come as a result of a concerted and diverse policy effort, from advanced research to tax credits, loans, pollution regulations, prizes and awards, and performance standards.
The bulk of the policy effort has come in blue states and at the federal executive level. (At least after 2010, the GOP Congress refused Obama any legislative help, on anything.)
Whether the federal side of that policy effort will continue depends on who is elected president in November.

The Paris agreement is building global momentum to tackle climate change, but we can't stop now. Don't let deniers derail progress.
Don't let deniers stand in the way
We listen to experts for a reason. When my car breaks, I go to a mechanic. When my tooth hurts, I go to the dentist. Experts have training and knowledge that we don't. So when 97 percent of climate scientists tell us that climate change is real and man-made, we should pay attention.But we still have an embarrassingly large number of elected representatives who won't listen, despite overwhelming scientific consensus (even 85 percent of eighth graders accept the science at this point). Not only do they refuse to accept it, many of them are actively working to roll back the progress we've already made. Just last week, 52 senators voted to eliminate the Clean Power Planwhat's been called the biggest action America's ever taken to cut our carbon pollution and tackle climate change. An extreme and vocal minority in Congress is trying to convince other countries that America won't live up to our international climate commitmentsright before countries around the world come together to cut carbon pollution, and stop the worsening economic and health impacts that come with it.Climate change deniers are doing more than embarrassing themselvesthey're threatening to undermine America's ability to show the world we're serious about this threat.It's up to us to make sure they don't succeed.

What I Learned from Professor Obama  The White House
Before he was President, he was a law professor. My professor. For more than 10 years, President Obama taught at the University of Chicago Law School, an institution known for its commitment to full and vigorous debate from all sides of the intellectual spectrum. Its where the late Justice Antonin Scalia served as a professor for several years and developed his originalist view of the Constitution. Its a school where all points of view are treated with respect and are subject to the same rigorous challenge. And its where President Obama will return this afternoon for the first time since moving into the White House to talk with law students about the enduring benefits of an impartial Supreme Court and how the current confirmation process holds the potential long-term consequences for some of our most important constitutional values. Tune in here to the conversation at 3:30 pm Eastern to catch the Presidents conversation on the Supreme Court.
For the first time in recent memory, Senate Republicans are flatly refusing to consider a Supreme Court nomination because they hope another party will win the next election. It isnt clear whether the Senate will ultimately deny the Presidents nominee a hearing or a vote for the entire year, so before positions harden, this is a good time for all of us to step back and think about the broader costs of this potential action to our judiciary. Professor Obama always insisted on class discussion. He didnt like to lecture. Rather, he liked to present difficult questions and require students to consider the logical extension of their arguments and decide whether they still maintained their positions. Professor Obama, like most law professors, used hypotheticals to illustrate his point. So consider this one: What if the next Senate declared that absolutely no Supreme Court appointments would be considered not just in the last year of the Presidents term, but for the Presidents entire term, regardless of how many vacancies might pile up, because they hoped someone else would be elected four years later?
We all want judges that are respected, independent, nonpartisan, and fair to everyone. Its not easy to create an impartial judicial system when the people who select and confirm our judges are elected and inherently partisan, especially when it requires collaboration between the President and Senate leadership, who often represent different parties. Thus, we rely on political leaders overcoming the political calculations of the moment in order to preserve something that benefits all of us: a truly independent system of justice. So join in today at 3:30 pm Eastern here and share your own thoughts on this issue using the hashtag #SCOTUS.
There is something precious and powerful about an independent judiciary, a branch of government that can and must maintain its impartiality in our political system. Its hard to do. I dont think we want future law professors to explain how 2016 began a cycle of blatant partisanship in judicial appointments and confirmations. An independent judiciary, born from the heart of our Constitution, is too important to imperil. Thats one of the lessons I learned from Professor Obama. I hope our Senators take that lesson to heart as well.

California, N.Y. Minimum Wage Hikes a Win for Populist Movement
In a political climate defined by stagnant wages for millions of workers, growing inequality and populist revolts in both parties, activists from outside of the political establishment and low-wage workers achieved a major victory on Monday when the Democratic governors of California and New York both signed bills that would gradually increase their states' minimum wages to $15 per hour.
Politically, the minimum wages hikes were the culmination of a strong push from both labor unions and liberal activist groups, despite some reluctance from leading Democrats, to significantly raise the minimum wage in states. Republicans in Congress have blocked a nationwide increase.
In terms of economic policy, these two states will now be laboratories to explore if substantial hikes in the minimum wage help boost earnings for minimum-wage workers and spur raises for other employees at companies, as liberals argue, or if they result in companies cutting jobs, as conservatives say.
Neither state has enacted a bill that would simply make wages $15 per hour immediately, which would be more than double the current $7.25 federal minimum wage. New York's minimum wage was $9 per hour. The provision signed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo will gradually increase wages in New York City to $15 per hour by the end of 2018 and in the counties surrounding New York City by 2021.
Wages will increase more slowly in the less expensive parts of the state, scheduled to reach $12.50 per hour by 2021 and $15 a few years after that.
California, which had a $10 minimum wage, will increase it statewide each year starting in 2017, until reaching $15 per hour in 2022. The governor of California, according to the law, can suspend the minimum wage increase if "seasonally adjusted statewide job growth for either the prior 3 or 6 months is negative and retail sales receipts for the prior 12 months is negative."
About 2 million people in California currently are paid the minimum wage, according to the office of Gov. Jerry Brown.
Both states have lower requirements for small businesses.
"Congratulations to 10 million workers in CA and NY. The #FightFor15 won't quit until we all have $15 + union rights," read a Twitter message from "Fight for 15," the group, backed by the Service Employees International Union, that has pushed for minimum wage hikes all over the country.
President Obama hailed the moves, as did his potential Democratic successors, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.
"Since I first called on Congress to increase the federal minimum wage in 2013, 18 states and more than 40 cities and counties have acted on their own -- thanks to the strong leadership of elected officials, businesses, and workers who organized and fought so hard for the economic security families deserve. Now Congress needs to act to raise the federal minimum wage and expand access to paid leave for all Americans," Obama said in a statement.
Clinton joined Cuomo at a rally celebrating the new law.
The California Chamber of Commerce, an influential business group in the state, warned,"This unprecedented increase in the minimum wage will overwhelm many businesses that already are struggling with the current minimum wage increase and will limit job growth in this state."
The passage of these two bills is a significant accomplishment for the "Fight for 15" movement. In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama called for an increase of the minimum wage to $9 per hour. Now, two states, where a combined 59 million of America's 320 million people live, have enacted much higher increases three years later.
The minimum hikes came after years of strikes by fast food workers in major cities across the country, as well as a push to get more moderate Democratic politicians, such as Cuomo, to embrace these provisions. While labor unions and liberal activists have made a $15 minimum wage nationally one of their core organizing principles, neither Clinton nor Obama has embraced this idea, although Sanders does.
The passage of these laws also illustrates the growing divide between red and blue states in an era when little is happening in Washington, because the president and Congress are from different parties. New York and California's politics are dominated by Democrats, leading to the embrace of proposals like this minimum wage increase.
Meanwhile, states like Indiana and Utah have passed new restrictions on abortion rights in the last few weeks, while North Carolina, another GOP-controlled state, enacted a controversial provision that stops localities in the state from passing laws that specifically ban discrimination based on sexual orientation.

The 10 most startling facts about climate in 2015  the warmest year on record
Last yearwas unequivocally the warmest year on record for Earth. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Tuesday released a 300-page report documenting the historic warmth as well as scores of other aspects of 2015s climate.
The hefty report, State of the Climate in 2015, was produced by more than 450 scientists from 62 countries around the world  more than any previous edition.
Every single direct indicator of temperature described in the report leaves no doubt that 2015s global surface temperature towered over any year preceding it. Numerous other climate indicators related to temperature exhibited characteristics consistent with such historic warmth.
2015s exceptional warmth was fueled by a record-challenging El Nio event, in which warmer-than-normal tropical Pacific Ocean waters infused heat into the atmosphere, and by record-setting concentrations of heat-trapping gases from human activity.
Here are the 10 most impressive findings from this report:
1. The global temperature was the highest on record.
Global average temperature in 2015 surpassed the record set just the year before by more than 0.1 of a degree Celsius. For the first time, the temperature surpassed preindustrial levels by more than 1 degree Celsius.
The average temperature over the ocean was 0.33 to 0.39 Celsius above average, besting the previous average by 0.10 to 0.12 Celsius. These warm waters fueled much higher than normal global tropical cyclone activity.
Five difference data sets showed record high amounts of heat stored in the upper layer of the ocean averaged around the globe.
Oceans expand as they warm, causing the sea level to rise. In addition, melting ice sheets and glaciers add to sea level. The sea level in 2015 was about 2.75 inches higher than 1993 average.
Over the past two decades, sea level has risen at a rate of 0.15 inches per year.
5. The El Nio event was among the strongest on record.
By most measures, the 2015/16 El Nio was one of the strongest on record, on par with those of 1982/83 and 1997/98, the report states. In addition to elevating global temperatures to record territory, the El Nio raised sea levels, intensified Pacific tropical cyclone activity, and led to drought in the parts of the tropics increasing wildfires and the release of carbon dioxide.
Drought area, globally, was the highest since the 1980s.
The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, for the first time, surpassed 400 parts per million in modern record. Methane and nitrous oxide, additional heat-trapping gases released into the atmosphere through human activity, also set record highs.
Thirty-one major tropical cyclones developed in the Northern Hemisphere, crushing the previous record of 23 set in 2004. Major tropical cyclones refer to hurricanes and/or typhoons that reach at least Category 3 on the 0-5 Saffir-Simpson wind scale.
Incredibly, 26 tropical cyclones reached Category 4 or 5 intensity, surpassing the previous record of 18.
In February 2015, the maximum sea ice extent in the Arctic was 7 percent below the 1981-2010 average, and the smallest on record. Temperatures in the Arctic land surface averaged over the year tied for warmest on record with 2007 and 2011, 2.8 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) above temperature in the early 20th century.
Last year marked the 36th straight year of Alpine glacier retreat globally.
10. Extreme temperatures were most extreme on record.
Regionally, the frequencies of warm days and warm nights were the highest on record in western North America, parts of Central Europe, and Central Asia, the report states. It added that 2015 had the fewest number of unusually cool days on record.
The report is available online and will be published by the Bulletin of the America Meteorological Society.

Obama vetoes anti-climate change measures passed by Congress

HONOLULU (AP)  President Barack Obama has vetoed two measures that would have blocked steps that his administration is taking to address climate change.
One would have nullified carbon pollution standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency. The second would have voided a set of national standards designed to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas pollution from existing power plants.
In a letter notifying Congress of his decision, Obama says climate change is a "profound threat" that must be addressed.
Some Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates scoff at the climate science.
Obama has made addressing climate change a priority. He recently praised a new international climate agreement reached at a Paris conference and credited his administration as being a driving force behind the deal.
He rejected the measures through a rare "pocket veto," intended to be used when Congress has adjourned, as it did Friday for the year. A pocket vote essentially takes effect when the president fails to sign a bill within 10 days.

The Paris Climate Deal Is President Obamas Biggest Accomplishment
This weekend, leaders from 196 countries approved the first global agreement to limit greenhouse-gas emissions in human history. The pact is a triumph of international diplomacy shared by diplomats across the planet. It also represents the culmination of a patient strategy by the Obama administration that unfolded over years, and which even many sympathetic journalists long dismissed as fanciful. Obamas climate agenda has lurked quietly on the recesses of the American imagination for most of his presidency. It is also probably the administrations most importantaccomplishment.
1. Climate change is different from other issues. The Obama administration has enacted important reforms to prevent a Great Depression, reform health care, overhaul the financial system and education, and craft important breakthroughs with Iran and Cuba. But climate change occupies a category of its own. The damage from climate change is irreversible. Melted glaciers cannot be easily refrozen; extinct species cannot be reborn; flooded coastal cities are unlikely to be rebuilt. Action to mitigate climate change has an urgency nothing else canmatch.
2. Paris is a BFD. In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for a global treaty to limit the effects of greenhouse-gas emissions. The United Nations spent the next quarter century trying, and failing, to organize effective world action, despite increasingly dire warnings of massive, deadly, irreversible change that would threaten human life as we know it. An extremely simple conclusion can be drawn from this timeline: A worldwide-climate-change agreement is incredibly hard to do. If the Paris agreement were a simple matter of serving some nice French meals and writing some vague feel-good goals, it would have taken less than a quarter-century tohappen.
3. Paris does not exist on its own. The Obama administrations climate strategy began with a massive infusion of $90 billion in green-energy financing in the stimulus, which set off a wave of new investment and research in wind, solar, storage, and other measures. Obama signed the stimulus in his first month in office, and hoped it would launch the passage of a cap-and-trade law and an international climate agreement in Copenhagen. But the strategy derailed badly. The 2009 negotiations in Copenhagen virtually collapsed, and cap and trade was blocked by a coalition of a handful of Democrats from fossil-fuel-producing states and almost the entire RepublicanParty.
At that point, Obamas climate strategy looked well and truly dead. Instead, the administration forged a different path. It used its existing regulatory power under the Clean Air Act to devise innovative new regulations to control greenhouse-gas emissions across the economy. The reductions it could wring from its regulatory powers gave the administration the leverage to negotiate a bilateral agreement with China in 2014. The U.S.-China agreement broke a deadlock between the industrialized West and the developing world that had paralyzed all previous international negotiations. The plunging costs of solar and wind energy, plus new innovations in storage and other clean-energy technologies, made it suddenly plausible for governments across the world to transition their energysystems.
4. Climate action is hard everywhere, but especially so in the United States. Climate change is a devilish issue for any politician, since the costs of action are heavily front-loaded, while the benefits lie far off in the future. Two features of American politics compound the difficulty. The United States has a somewhat unusual form of government in which the legislature and the executive branch can be controlled by opposing parties, which means that the president can negotiate a deal with other world leaders without being able to guarantee his governments support for the result. Any formal treaty requires the approval of two-thirds of the Senate, which is itself an undemocratic body giving disproportionate representation to citizens from small, ruralstates.
Worse still, the United States is the only country in the democratic world that has a major party that questions the scientific theory of anthropogenic global warming. Conservative parties abroad often take more market-oriented, or perhaps less-ambitious, approaches toward limiting carbon emissions. But the stance taken by the Republican Party, in which respected leading figures endorse kook conspiracy theories, is simply not heard anywhere else. And even the Republican leaders who hesitate to openly endorse conspiracy theories utterly dismiss any international action to limit greenhouse-gasemissions.
The interplay of both these dynamics has placed the Obama administration in a singularly difficult position. The U.S. is the worlds largest historic emitter of greenhouse gases, and the leader of the free world. Yet its political system makes the passage of any legally binding international climate treaty utterly inconceivable. The Paris agreement had to work around this obstacle. The result was highly innovative: a collection of pledges from nearly every country that, without formal legal force, nonetheless took on diplomaticweight.
5. Success begets success. Much of the coverage of the Paris agreement has struck a sober note, depicting the agreement as a first step, or cautioning that now comes the hard part. All the caveats are perfectly true. The pledges amount to about half of the reductions necessary to bring emissions down to a level scientists consider safe, as this chart compiled by Brad Plumer shows:
Mitigating climate change is not a simple yes-no proposition. Holding temperature increases to 2.5 or 2.7 degrees Celsius may not be as good as holding them below 2 degrees, but its much better than holding them to 3.3 or 3.8 degrees. Whats more, the structure of the agreement is designed to produce additional reductions over time. At the urging of the U.S., countries are required to reconvene every half-decade and consider tighterreductions.
Obviously, such reductions will only happen if they are economically feasible. But recent history shows that political willpower and innovation feed off each other. Support for green energy in the United States (through the stimulus), Europe, China, and elsewhere spurred research and investment that have triggered a revolution in affordable solar and wind power, among other green-energy technologies. The green-energy revolution has made what was unaffordable in 2009 suddenly affordable. It is realistic to assume that the momentum from Paris will continue the virtuous cycle of political willpower and market innovation  the massive new market for reducing carbon emissions will spur more investment that will produce newer and more efficient technologies, allowing elected officials to make deeper emissionscuts.
It is hard to find any important accomplishment in history that completely solved a problem. The Emancipation Proclamation only temporarily and partially ended slavery; the 13th Amendment was required to abolish it permanently, and even that left many former slaves in a state of terrorized peonage closely resembling their former bondage. The Lend-Lease Act alone did not ensure Great Britain would survive against Nazi Germany; the Normandy invasion did not ensure the liberation of Europe. Victories are hardly ever immediate or complete. The fight continues and history marches on. The climate agreement in Paris should take its place as one of the great triumphs inhistory.

Nominating Supreme Court justices is Obama's job. Let him do it.
Justice Antonin Scalia had been dead only a few hours when Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the Senate wouldn't act on any replacement proposed by President Obama. The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice, McConnell (R-Ky.) said. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.
This is self-serving sophistry. The American people do have a voice in any nomination Obama makes. They spoke when they elected him to a second term that has 11 months remaining. His authority to nominate Supreme Court justices is no more diminished by his supposed lame-duck status than any of his other constitutional powers.
The Senate also has a constitutional duty: to consider presidential nominees expeditiously. A long vacancy is undesirable in part because a court comprised of only eight members raises the possibility of 4-4 decisions that, while they affirm a lower court's decision, don't create a national precedent.
The obstructionism being threatened by Senate Republicans is outrageous. It would be equally so if the circumstances were reversed and a Republican president in the last year of his term were sending a nominee to a Democratic Senate. That nominee also would deserve prompt consideration.
No doubt it's galling for Senate Republicans that Scalia's sudden death creates the possibility of a third Obama appointee and one, moreover, who is almost certainly not going to share Scalia's strikingly narrow view of the Constitution.
But there is no truth to the idea that Supreme Court nominations in an election year have an inferior status. Some Republicans have cited the so-called Thurmond Rule, a supposed tradition that the Senate need not act on judicial nominations in an administration's final year. It is named after the late Sen. Strom Thurmond, who along with other senators successfully blocked President Lyndon B. Johnson's attempt to promote Abe Fortas to chief justice in 1968, a presidential election year. But the rule has no formal status and has not been consistently honored. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, for example, was confirmed in 1988.
As a matter of practical politics, the Republican majority in the Senate  and the fact that Supreme Court nominations may be filibustered  make it unlikely that Obama would nominate a strident or doctrinaire liberal. But, like any president, he is likely to choose a candidate with whom he feels a philosophical affinity.
If Obama's eventual choice resembles the impressive judges he has appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, it will be hard for Republicans in the Senate to denounce that nominee as a radical. Republicans will still have the option of opposing the nominee, but if their only rationale is that they don't want to confirm an appointment by a Democratic president, their partisanship and disrespect for the court will be blatantly obvious.
It's true that both parties in the Senate in recent years have reacted to judicial nominations with excessive partisanship. President Ronald Reagan's nomination of Scalia to the court was confirmed by a vote of 98 to 0 in 1986. President Bill Clinton's nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg was approved 96 to 3 in 1993. It's inconceivable that any nominee, however moderate, would receive such an overwhelming margin of support today. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. was confirmed in 2005 by a vote of 78 to 22; all of the no votes were cast by Democrats (including then-Sen. Barack Obama). In 2010, 36 Republicans (and only one Democrat) voted against confirmation of Justice Elena Kagan.
This increased partisanship may have infected the court itself, with justices being publicly lobbied to time their retirements so that they will be replaced by a president of their own party. To prevent such gamesmanship, some have proposed that the Constitution be amended to provide for fixed but generous terms for Supreme Court justices. It's an idea worth considering.
In the meantime, election-year partisanship should not prevent either the president or the Senate from doing their respective duties. After consulting with the Senate, Obama should nominate a successor for Scalia who commands broad respect; Republicans in the Senate should then give him or her fair consideration and an up-or-down vote.

What South by South Lawn is all about:  The White House
Whenever I hear people make gloomy claims about how America is on the downswing, theyre either out to promote themselves, or talking about some alternate reality. Think about itif you had to choose any time in the course of human history to be alive, youd choose this one. Right here, right now, right in America.
New technologies and new innovations are transforming the way we live, opening up incredible opportunities to create, to discover, and to do what we never thought possible.
At the same time, we have to navigate these changes in a smart way. They also can be disruptive, even scaryand sometimes, they leave folks behind.
Our task is to come together and build a future thats more inclusive, tolerant, and full of opportunity for everybody. And Ive never been more optimistic that we will.
As President, Ive spent the last eight years finding the best people to help us meet that challenge. People who reject cynicism. People who turn change into a force for good. People who believe that, no matter who we are, where we come from, who we love, or what God we pray to, wethe peoplecan create a world thats worthy of our brightest hopes.
So today, Im inviting a bunch of these folks to my backyard for South by South Lawn.
Much like the festival I dropped by in Austin earlier this year, SXSL is, at its heart, a call to action. The folks out on the lawn today are artists, creators, entrepreneurs, and innovators who will share how theyve used their unique skills to engage their communities in making the change they want to seewhether its curing cancer, fighting poverty, empowering women, and so much more.
Well welcome people like Jukay Hsu, an Iraq War veteran with a Bronze Star for his service to our country who uses technology to build a path out of poverty for people in Queens. Or Oscar Menjivar, who is pushing schools in Los Angeles to bring technology into the classroom so kids can get a head start on coding. Or Dr. Nina Tandon, the founder of the worlds first company growing living human bones to help with reconstruction and recovery.
Those are just a few of the incredible people youll see out at South by South Lawn all day today. And believe meits a sight to see:
Weve got an art installation made entirely of sticky notes where people share how they will make a positive impact where they live. Weve got a virtual reality exhibit where people can experience what its like to live in solitary confinement and learn firsthand why it should be banned from our prisons.
Well discuss questions that will define the coming decades: How do we harness technology to solve our most stubborn problems? How will we sustainably feed ourselves in the near future? How do we foster innovation in the heart of our cities? How do we, as citizens, engage to bring about lasting change?
And Ill join a conversation with Dr. Katherine Hayhoe, a climate scientist, and Leonardo DiCaprio, a longtime ally in the fight against climate change, to explore how we can move forward in our efforts to protect the one planet weve got. Leo is also debuting his documentary film on climate change tonight.
Thats our responsibility as citizens. That doesnt mean this has be your full-time job. It doesnt mean you have to run for office or launch a start-up. But it does mean that whatever field youre in, whatever skill you have, whatever passion youre pursuing, you can find a way to engage, to participate, and to make a difference.
See you on the lawn.

Obama designates new national monuments in the California desert
President Obama has set aside more of Americas lands and waters for conservation protection than any of his predecessors, and he is preparing to do even more before he leaves office next year. The result may be one of the most expansive environmental and historic-preservation legacies in presidential history.
On Friday, Obama designated more than 1.8 million acres of California desert for protection with the creation of three national monuments: Castle Mountains, Mojave Trails and Sand to Snow. The new monuments will connect three existing sites  Death Valley and Joshua Tree national parks and the Mojave National Preserve  to create the second-largest desert preserve in the world.
Namib-Naukluft National Park in Namibia is the largest.
Obama has unilaterally protected more than 260 million acres of Americas lands and waters under the Antiquities Act of 1906, which gives the president wide latitude to safeguard at-risk federal lands that have cultural, historic or scientific value.
The act is among the most powerful tools at any presidents disposal. Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the law more than any president in history; Harold L. Ickes, his interior secretary, kept a pile of potential national-monument declarations in a desk and pulled them out whenever Roosevelt was in a good mood.
Obamas aides do not have a similar system, but they share those earlier aspirations.
We have big, big ambitions this year, so lets see what happens, said Christy Goldfuss, managing director of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, adding that the administration is focused on local requests for action. Its really been driven by activities on the ground.
[How Obama has built on George W. Bushs marine legacy]
The big question: What next?
Other possible future designations include Bears Ears, a sacred site for several Native American tribes in southeastern Utah; Stonewall, the site of a 1969 inn riot by members of New York Citys gay community; the New England Coral Canyons and Seamounts; the historic headquarters of the National Womans Party, Sewall-Belmont House in Washington, D.C.; and Nevadas Gold Butte, an area where rancher Cliven Bundy and his supporters have defied federal authorities.
Officials are weighing these proposals amid protests out West, such as the armed occupation of Oregons Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which aimed to wrest control of federal lands from officials in Washington. The standoff may have hurt the prospects for increased protections around the states Owyhee Canyonlands, though the idea is not off the table entirely.
But Jim Messina, a close Obama adviser who worked on conservation issues when he served as White House deputy chief of staff in his first term, said the president is personally committed to the issue and is convinced that most Americans back the idea.
Protecting public access is a huge political winner across the West. A bunch of extremists in Oregon cant change it, he said. Theres no thought, or no reason, to back off on our agenda.
Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who convinced Obama to declare a sizeable monument in Nevadas Basin and Range Province last year, is still pressing for getting another one at Gold Butte, which is an hours drive from Las Vegas but has been degraded and largely unpoliced since Bundy and his armed followers confronted Bureau of Land Management officials there in 2014.
Republicans have been trying to curtail Obamas powers to act, but in a year when several senators are up for reelection in swing states, they have fallen short. Last week, the Senate considered an amendment by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) that would have reversed national-monument designations if Congress and lawmakers in the affected states did not explicitly approve them within three years of designation. Four Republicans  including Kelly Ayotte (N.H.) and Mark Kirk (Ill.)  broke ranks and voted against it, and it was defeated 48 to 47.
House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah) said in an interview Wednesday that he was not surprised at the votes outcome. 
Most people do not understand what Antiquities does, or can do, he said. At some point, we have to realize this is a process that is out of control. Whether that actually occurs before Obama leaves is irrelevant.
The Obama administration and Bishop have starkly different readings of the law, which runs just four paragraphs. It dictates that any monument designation shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected, but presidents have interpreted that broadly over the past century.
The White House has identified two main criteria for naming monuments this year, Goldfuss said: areas that help foster resilience to climate change or are connected to people and communities that have not been historically represented in national parks and other federal sites.
That explains new California desert designations, for which Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) has been seeking protection for seven years. David Lamfrom, who directs the National Parks Conservation Associations California desert and national wildlife programs, said connecting the ecosystem across nearly 10 million acres will help species with large ranges, such as bighorn sheep and mountain lions, as well as imperiled desert tortoises and ones that are taking refuge at higher altitudes where there is more moisture.
The idea is to link together these large landscapes in perpetuity, Lamfrom said, so species can migrate and have the best chance of survival in the face of human pressures.
Five members  the Navajo Nation, the Hopi Tribe, the Ute Indian Tribe, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe and the Pueblo of Zuni  have created the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition to press for a monument on roughly 1.9 million acres in of Utah that were once inhabited by the Anasazi and, later, the Navajo.
Eric Descheenie, who co-chairs the coalition and serves as executive staff assistant to the Navajo Nation president, said: Weve had the looting and grave robbing and destruction of sacred sites, even as several tribes have continued to gather medicinal herbs and berries, haul wood, hunt and conduct religious ceremonies there.
In some instances, Republican lawmakers have offered their own vision of how to protect these areas, but bipartisan agreements have proven elusive. Rep. Paul Cook (R-Calif.) has introduced a California desert bill that would put more than 1.2 million acres in the region off limits to development, but it would bar the use of the Antiquities Act, open up 100,000 acres of new mining in Mojave Trails and sanction off-road vehicle use in some areas.
It is less clear what Obama will do in federal waters, where nearly all of the strict protections are in the central Pacific. There are a group of Hawaiians lobbying the president to expand Papahanaumokuakea  a monument George W. Bush created a decade ago, whose islands and atolls are home to 1,750 marine species found nowhere else on Earth  to the full extent under the law. That would make it 520,000 square miles, or nine times its current size.
Some people here are working here to provide the president with a legacy opportunity, said William Aila Jr., looking down from a rocky outcropping in Oahu as two endangered Hawaiian monk seals nestled below. It would be the largest marine protected area for a long, long time. It would be almost impossible to top it.

For the next Justice, Americans want a nominee and a hearing
Most Americans want to see President Barack Obama nominate someone to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but the public is divided on what ideological tilt they'd prefer to see in a nominee, according to a new CNN/ORC poll published Thursday.
The poll also finds those surveyed are also split on whether Senate Republicans would be justified in using the filibuster or other procedural moves to prevent a vote on a nominee they oppose.
Overall, 58% say they'd like to see the President nominate someone to the Court rather than leave the seat vacant until a new president takes office next year, 41% would prefer a vacancy.
And more -- 66% -- say that whomever Obama nominates should get a hearing in the Senate. But once that happens, 48% say that if most or all Republicans in the Senate oppose Obama's nominee, they would be justified in preventing a vote to confirm him or her.
Obama has said he does plan to nominate someone for the seat, and has called on the Senate to vote on his nominee. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has said the Senate Judiciary Committee would not hold hearings on any nominee put forward by Obama, nor would the full body vote on Obama's choice.
The public's divisions by party are almost as deep as those found in Washington. While majorities of Democrats (82%) and independents (59%) want the President to nominate someone to fill the seat, just 29% of Republicans agree. And while Republicans see blocking a vote via Senate procedure as a justifiable move (77%), independents are more divided on that question (46% say it's justified), while Democrats are not on board, just 25% say it's justified. On one matter, however, there is partisan agreement. Majorities of Republicans (67%), independents (69%) and Democrats (60%) want the GOP leadership in the Senate to hold hearings on the nominee. Regardless of the procedural moves involved in handling the nomination, Americans are divided on how they'd prefer Scalia's replacement to impact the Court's ideological tilt. A plurality (37%) say Obama should nominate someone who would keep the Court about as it was, while 32% would prefer a justice who tilts the balance toward the liberal side of things, 29% more conservative. A majority of Democrats prefer a more liberal Court, while most Republicans favor a more conservative one, and independents split 30% more liberal, 26% more conservative and 40% as it was. With the battle over a Supreme Court nominee looming, the poll finds Obama has gotten a small boost in his approval rating over the last month, with 50% now saying they approve of his performance and 46% disapproving. That's up from 47% approval in late January, and it's the first time that measure has hit 50% in CNN/ORC polling since June 2015. The 46% who disapprove mark the lowest share to say so since 2013. Presidential approval often ebbs and flows with impressions of the economy, but the poll suggests that isn't what's boosting Obama's ratings now. The public has a slightly worsened view of the national economy compared with December, with 46% calling it good and 53% poor. Those figures stood at 49% good to 51% poor in December. Nearly half say their personal financial situation is better than it was a year ago (45%), up from 42% saying so last April, but the share saying they're worse off has also climbed, from 34% last April to 39% now. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone February 24-27 among a random national sample of 1,001 adults. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

A Mother's Day Surprise from President Obama
Americans wages just hit an all-time high
The inflation adjusted weekly income of the typical full-time American worker hit an all-time high in the third quarter of 2016, according to data released yesterday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Median weekly earnings had been approximately stagnant for the first 15 years of the 21st century. (They spiked temporarily during the Great Recession because low-wage workers were disproportionately likely to be laid off.) But earnings have rebounded sharply over the past 18 months. Thats a mix of an improving labor market giving workers some bargaining power and cheap energy prices keeping inflation low.
This is a slightly different finding from the Census Bureaus report in September that median household income surged in 2015. The Census looks at all households, whether theyre working or unemployed or retired, while the BLS looks only at individuals who have a job. But the two reports point in the same direction  the economy is getting stronger for ordinary people.

Support global action on climate change
The Paris agreement is building global momentum to tackle climate change, but we can't stop now. Don't let deniers derail progress.
Twitter Video
President Obama: The United States Formally Enters the Paris Agreement  The White House
Last December, more than 190 countries adopted the Paris Agreement, the most ambitious climate change agreement in history. In order for the agreement to take effect and enter into force, at least 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions need to formally join the Agreement.
Today, the United States and China deposited with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon their respective instruments to join the Paris Agreement, marking a significant contribution towards the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement.
Todays action by the United States and China to formally join is a significant step towards entry into force this year with countries representing around 40 percent of global emissions having now joined and more than 55 countries having already joined or publicly committed to work towards joining the agreement this year.
We are here together because we believe that for all the challenges that we face, the growing threat of climate change could define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other challenge.
One of the reasons I ran for this office was to make sure that America does its part to protect this planet for future generations. Over the past seven and a half years, weve transformed the United States into a global leader in the fight against climate change. But this is not a fight that any one country, no matter how powerful, can take alone. Thats why last Decembers Paris Agreement was so important. Nearly 200 nations came together asa strong, enduring framework to set the world on a course to a low-carbon future.
There are no shortage of cynics who thought the agreement would not happen. But they missed two big things: The investments that we made to allow for incredible innovation in clean energy, and the strong, principled diplomacy over the course of years that we were able to see pay off in the Paris Agreement. The United States and China were central to that effort. Over the past few years, our joint leadership on climate has been one of the most significant drivers of global action.
In 2014, President Xi and I stood together in Beijing to announce landmark climate targets for our two countries to meet. That announcement set us on the road to Paris by jumpstarting an intense diplomatic effort to put other countries on the same course. In 2015, we stood together in Washington to lay out additional actions our two countries would take, along with a roadmap for ultimately reaching a strong agreement in Paris. This year, in 2016, we meet again to commit formally to joining the agreement ahead of schedule, creating the prospect that the agreement might enter into force ahead of schedule, as well.
Of course, we could not have done this extraordinary work without the strong support of the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has been an outstanding leader on this issue, as well.
Now, just as I believe the Paris Agreement will ultimately prove to be a turning point for our planet, I believe that history will judge todays efforts as pivotal. For the agreement to enter into force, as has already been stated, 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions must formally join.
We have a saying in Americathat you need to put your money where your mouth is. And when it comes to combatting climate change, thats what were doing, both the United States and China. Were leading by example. As the worlds two largest economies and two largest emitters, our entrance into this agreement continues the momentum of Paris, and should give the rest of the world confidence - whether developed or developing countries - that a low-carbon future is where the world is heading.
Of course, the Paris Agreement alone wont solve the climate crisis. But it does establish an enduring framework that enables countries to ratchet down their carbon emissions over time, and to set more ambitious targets as technology advances. That means full implementation of this agreement will help delay or avoid some of the worst consequences of climate change, and pave the way for more progress in the coming years.
President Xi and I intend to continue working together in the months ahead to make sure our countries lead on climate. Three years ago, in California, we first resolved to work together to secure a global agreement to phase down the use of super pollutants known as HFCs, and were now just six weeks away from final negotiations. We also have the chance to reach a global agreement to curb emissions from the global airline industry - one that actually has the support of industry. And today, were putting forward roadmaps to get both negotiations done this year.
On each of these issues, the United States and China have now developed a significant record of leadership on one of the most important issues of our time. Our teams have worked together and developed a strong relationship that should serve us very well. And despite our differences on other issues, we hope that our willingness to work together on this issue will inspire greater ambition and greater action around the world.
And I was reflecting before we came in here with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon about the meeting that we had in Copenhagen in my first year of my presidency, which was quite chaotic. And I think it is fair to say that if you had looked at the outcome of that meeting, the prospects of us being here today, the prospects of a Paris Agreement seemed very far away. And yet, here we are, which indicates that where theres a will and theres a vision, and where countries like China and the United States are prepared to show leadership and to lead by example, it is possible for us to create a world that is more secure, more prosperous, and more free than the one that was left for us.
So to all of you that have participated in this extraordinary effort, thank you very much. Thank you to President Xi. Thank you to the Secretary General.

Show This Chart to Any of the Climate-Change Deniers You're Unfortunate Enough to Know
It's no secret there's a huge disparity between what Americans think about climate change and what most scientists think about climate change.
Opinions on climate change vary, but there are a fewindisputable factsthat are hard to ignore. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in our atmosphere. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide. Humans have burned a lot of fossil fuels over the last couple centuries, which in turn has released more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and global temperatures have risen. Ice and glaciers have shrunk significantly in the last few decades, and sea levels have risen almost seven inches in the last century.
Now you can see some of these climate change effects in a chilling interactive, created by NASA, called the Climate Time Machine. It shows how temperature, carbon dioxide, sea level and sea ice on Earth have all dramatically changed over time.
In the first section, you can see how global temperatures have risen from 1884 to 2015. Blue colors represent cooler temperatures, while red and yellow symbolize warmer ones:
From 2002, you can see how much carbon dioxide has been added to the atmosphere. Green represents less, while yellow represents more:
There's also a sea ice and sea level interactive that shows how the Earth could be affected if too much ice melts.
NASA's climate change research programs have faced a lot of challenges due to one man: presidential candidate Ted Cruz, an open climate change denier,who was made chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees NASA. In 2015, Cruz advised that NASA was ignoring its core mission of space exploration by focusing on Earth science. But NASA maintains that one of its most important functions is to study Earth, especially climate change.

Heres the Deal: The Text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership  The Trans-Pacific Partnership
When we have a level playing field, Americans out-compete anyone in the world. Thats a fundamental truth about our country.
But right now, the rules of global trade put our workers, our businesses, and our values at a disadvantage.
If youre an autoworker in Michigan, the cars you build face taxes as high as 70 percent in Vietnam. If youre a worker in Oregon, youre forced to compete against workers in other countries that set lower standards and pay lower wages just to cut their costs. If youre a small business owner in Ohio, you might face customs rules that are confusing, costly, and an unnecessary barrier to selling abroad.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership will change that.
Its the highest standard trade agreement in history. It eliminates 18,000 taxes that various countries put on American goods. That will boost Made-in-America exports abroad while supporting higher-paying jobs right here at home. And thats going to help our economy grow.
I know that past trade agreements havent always lived up to the hype. Thats what makes this trade agreement so different, and so important.
The TPP includes the strongest labor standards in history, from requiring a minimum wage and worker safety regulations to prohibiting child labor and forced labor. It also includes the strongest environmental commitments in history, requiring countries in one of the most biologically diverse areas on Earth to crack down on illegal wildlife trafficking, illegal logging, and illegal fishing. These standards are at the core of the agreement and are fully enforceablewhich means we can bring trade sanctions against countries that dont step up their game.
And for the first time ever, well have a multilateral trade agreement that reflects the reality of the digital economy by promoting a free and open Internet and by preventing unfair laws that restrict the free flow of data and information.
In other words, the TPP means that America will write the rules of the road in the 21st century. When it comes to Asia, one of the worlds fastest-growing regions, the rulebook is up for grabs. And if we dont pass this agreementif America doesnt write those rulesthen countries like China will. And that would only threaten American jobs and workers and undermine American leadership around the world.
Thats why I am posting the text of this agreement here for you to read and explore. Theres a lot in here, so weve put together summaries of each chapter to help you navigate whats in the agreement and what these new standards will mean for you.
I know that if you take a look at whats actually in the TPP, you will see that this is, in fact, a new type of trade deal that puts American workers first.

Obamacare Shopping Is More Important Than Ever

Merrick Garland Deserves a VoteFor Democracys Sake
For more than 40 years, there has been an average of just over two months between a presidents nominating someone to the Supreme Court and that persons receiving a hearing in Congress. It has now been more than four months since I nominated Merrick Garland, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuitand Congress left town for a seven-week recess without giving him a hearing, let alone an up-or-down vote.
This is much more serious than your typical case of Washington dysfunction. And if we allow it to continue, the consequences of congressional inaction could weaken our most important institutions, erode public trust and undermine our democracy.
Every Supreme Court nominee since 1875 who hasnt withdrawn from the process has received a hearing or a vote. Even when the nominee was controversial. Even when the Senate and the White House were held by different parties.
But Chief Judge Garland isnt controversial. He has more federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in our history. He is widely respected by people of both political parties as a man of experience, integrity and unimpeachable qualifications. The partisan decision of Senate Republicans to deny a hearing to a judge who has served his country with honor and dignity is not just an insult to a good manit is an unprecedented escalation of the stakes. It threatens the very process by which we nominate judges, regardless of who our next president is. And it should concern every American who cares about the rule of law and upholding the institutions that make our democracy work.
Heres why. Historically, when a president nominates a Supreme Court justiceregardless of when in the presidential term this occursthe Senate is obligated to act. Senators are free to vote their conscience. But they vote. Thats their job.
If Republicans in the Senate refuse even to consider a nominee in the hopes of running out the clock until they can elect a president from their own party, so that he can nominate his own justice to the Supreme Court, then they will effectively nullify the ability of any president from the opposing party to make an appointment to the nations highest court. They would reduce the very functioning of the judicial branch of the government to another political leverage point.
We cannot allow the judicial confirmation process to descend into an endless cycle of political retaliation. There would be no path to fill a vacancy for the highest court in the land. The process would stall. Court backlogs would grow. An entire branch of government would be unable to fulfill its constitutional role. And some of the most important questions of our time would go unanswered.
This is troubling for two reasons. First, a functioning judiciaryat every levelis essential to the business of the nation. For example, last month, a deadlocked Supreme Court was unable to reach a decision on several major issues, leaving the law itself in limbo. Across the country, judicial vacancies are leaving some lower courts so overwhelmed they can barely make it through their dockets. Twenty-nine judicial emergencies have been declared by lower courts across the country. This has real implications for jurisprudence, real financial costs to the judicial system and real consequences in the lives of people awaiting the outcomes of those cases.
Second, treating the Supreme Court like a political football makes the American people more cynical about democracy. When the Supreme Court becomes a proxy for political parties, public confidence in the notion of an impartial, independent judiciary breaks down. And the resulting lack of trust can undermine the rule of law.
So heres an idea. Democrats and Republicans in the Senate could agree to give Chief Judge Garland a hearing when they return from their extended recess, while also committing to give every future qualified Supreme Court nominee a hearing and a vote within an established time frame. Its a good idea that my predecessor, President George W. Bush, suggested during his time in office. This reasonable proposal would prevent the confirmation process from breaking down beyond repair, and help restore good faith between the two parties.
In my travels around the world as president, I have seen how hard democracy ishow it takes more than a proclamation or even an election. Democracies depend on the institutions we build, the rules upon which the nation is founded, and the traditions, customs and habits of heart that guide our behavior and ensure that political differences never override the founding ideals that bind us. And it is on usall of usto preserve and protect them.
Now we need Congress to act. We need senators to demonstrate that, once again, America has the capacity to rise above disagreements and maintain a fidelity to the values that, for 240 years, have made this extraordinary experiment a success. Thats what the American people deserveand its what makes ours the greatest country the world has ever known.
Mr. Obama is the president of the United States.

For the next Justice, Americans want a nominee and a hearing
Most Americans want to see President Barack Obama nominate someone to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but the public is divided on what ideological tilt they'd prefer to see in a nominee, according to a new CNN/ORC poll published Thursday.
The poll also finds those surveyed are also split on whether Senate Republicans would be justified in using the filibuster or other procedural moves to prevent a vote on a nominee they oppose.
Overall, 58% say they'd like to see the President nominate someone to the Court rather than leave the seat vacant until a new president takes office next year, 41% would prefer a vacancy.
And more -- 66% -- say that whomever Obama nominates should get a hearing in the Senate. But once that happens, 48% say that if most or all Republicans in the Senate oppose Obama's nominee, they would be justified in preventing a vote to confirm him or her.
Obama has said he does plan to nominate someone for the seat, and has called on the Senate to vote on his nominee. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has said the Senate Judiciary Committee would not hold hearings on any nominee put forward by Obama, nor would the full body vote on Obama's choice.
The public's divisions by party are almost as deep as those found in Washington. While majorities of Democrats (82%) and independents (59%) want the President to nominate someone to fill the seat, just 29% of Republicans agree. And while Republicans see blocking a vote via Senate procedure as a justifiable move (77%), independents are more divided on that question (46% say it's justified), while Democrats are not on board, just 25% say it's justified. On one matter, however, there is partisan agreement. Majorities of Republicans (67%), independents (69%) and Democrats (60%) want the GOP leadership in the Senate to hold hearings on the nominee. Regardless of the procedural moves involved in handling the nomination, Americans are divided on how they'd prefer Scalia's replacement to impact the Court's ideological tilt. A plurality (37%) say Obama should nominate someone who would keep the Court about as it was, while 32% would prefer a justice who tilts the balance toward the liberal side of things, 29% more conservative. A majority of Democrats prefer a more liberal Court, while most Republicans favor a more conservative one, and independents split 30% more liberal, 26% more conservative and 40% as it was. With the battle over a Supreme Court nominee looming, the poll finds Obama has gotten a small boost in his approval rating over the last month, with 50% now saying they approve of his performance and 46% disapproving. That's up from 47% approval in late January, and it's the first time that measure has hit 50% in CNN/ORC polling since June 2015. The 46% who disapprove mark the lowest share to say so since 2013. Presidential approval often ebbs and flows with impressions of the economy, but the poll suggests that isn't what's boosting Obama's ratings now. The public has a slightly worsened view of the national economy compared with December, with 46% calling it good and 53% poor. Those figures stood at 49% good to 51% poor in December. Nearly half say their personal financial situation is better than it was a year ago (45%), up from 42% saying so last April, but the share saying they're worse off has also climbed, from 34% last April to 39% now. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted by telephone February 24-27 among a random national sample of 1,001 adults. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Today, We Will Change Tomorrow | Huffington Post
As we kick off Women's History Month today, let's remind ourselves that it is a powerful time to be a woman. We now do it all, from CEOs, to scientists, teachers, mothers, small business owners, elected officials, activists, and volunteers. And so many women and men are uniting behind the belief that, both individually and collectively, today we will change tomorrow.
On March 11, 2009, President Obama took an important step for women and girls across the country and around the world when he signed an Executive Order establishing the White House Council on Women and Girls. From that day forward, the Council has engaged every agency and department throughout the Federal Government to ensure that in every policy, program, and legislation we support, we take into account the needs and aspirations of women and girls.
 As the Chair of the first White House Council on Women and Girls, it has been my honor to lead the President's efforts to improve the quality of life for women and girls. Talent is ubiquitous, but opportunity is not. During the last seven years, we have focused on expanding opportunities for women and girls: from the very first bill President Obama signed, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, to making college more affordable, expanding opportunities for girls pursuing education and careers in STEM, ensuring women have access to preventive health care services, encouraging the adoption of family friendly policies in the workplace -- including equal pay, paid leave, sick days, affordable child care, and increasing the minimum wage -- working to end domestic violence and sexual assault, and much more. And around the world, we have worked to promote the economic and political empowerment of women through the Equal Futures Partnership, initiated a National Action Place on Women Peace and Security, and worked to combat gender based violence and human trafficking.
That's why, throughout this Women's History Month, the White House Council on Women and Girls will highlight the important progress Federal agencies have made, often in partnership with the private sector, not-for-profits, and other stakeholders. Every agency has challenged itself to seek and create new opportunities for women and girls in different and exciting ways.
So make sure to look out for highlights throughout the month. From Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet of the Small Business Administration emphasizing the work we have done with women entrepreneurs, to NASA's Administrator Charlie Bolden, highlighting the first class of astronauts comprised of half women, to Secretary of Labor Tom Perez, who is working to ensure that women can thrive both at work and at home, we look forward to sharing the important work of our nation's public servants.
While we have made enormous progress, we realize we have plenty of work still to do. But as First Lady Michelle Obama has said, "There is no limit to what we, as women, can accomplish."
In May, we'll take that next step, with The United State of Women Summit. Convened by the White House, this summit will rally the Administration and leaders from every sector across the country and the world to celebrate what we have achieved, and how we will move forward, together. Covering key gender equality issues, we will make a powerful difference in our collective future.
We will not develop every solution in that one day. But by bringing together some of the best minds in the country, and from around the world, to share bright new ideas, we can change tomorrow. We can take the next step on our long journey toward perfecting our union - of making sure that in America, everyone has a full seat at the table.
So this Women's History Month, we are thrilled to highlight the progress we have made together these seven years, and chart a path forward into the future. Join us at www.theunitedstateofwomen.org and sign up to learn more - because today, we change tomorrow.

Chief Judge Merrick Garland: The Public Servant  The White House
Few people are better positioned to speak about Judge Garlands commitment to the rule of law and his dedication to advancing equal justice under the law more than the clerks that have worked for him over the years.
See what he had to say about it in the official questionnaire he sent up to the Senate this week:
For him, pro bono service is a fundamental part of the legal professiona lesson he imparted to all those he worked with.
Throughout his career, Chief Judge Garland has dedicated his time and legal expertise to helping others who could not afford the representation they deserve under the law. As he said earlier this year:
The kids are always a little bit in awe of the person their parents refer to simply as the Judge. In fact, I can remember one year as we were on our way to the brunch, my young son asked nervously if the Judge would be wearing a white wig and carrying a gavel. But Judge Garland quickly puts the kids at ease, getting right down on the floor to play with them and even putting together a scavenger hunt for them in the backyard.
Jessica Ring Amunson: I love to watch Judge Garland at the brunch that he and his family host every year at their home for the Judges clerks and grandclerks (the children of his clerks).
Several of them took some time to reflect on who Merrick Garland is as a federal judge and how his dedication to public service has shaped their own lives as lawyers. Heres what clerks Eric Berger, Kendall Turner, Josh Segal, Previn Warren, and Jessica Ring Amunson have to say about their former boss:
Previn Warren: Whenever the Judges daughters calledno matter what he was in the middle of doinghe would pick up the phone and talk to them. He could be in the middle of a complex, arcane, dense analysis of the most intricate legal issuesif Becky or Jessie called, the Judge could switch gears immediately and be Chief Dad, ready to talk about college or career decisions, boys, Rihanna, whatever.
People have commented endlessly about the Judges brilliance, his fairness, and his long history of accomplishments, but most people dont realize that he has been able to balance all that while being an incredibly warm and caring father. I started my clerkship just a month after my first son was born and I was always struck by the Judges ability to so expertly balance his work and family life. That is a rare quality in someone of his stature and its representative of who he is as a person, not just a jurist.
Josh Segal: Id been working closely with Judge Garland on an opinion that had gone through a number of drafts, and we were nearing the finish line.
We talked through potential ways of handling one particularly difficult legal issue, and the Judge stopped and asked: Are we coming out the right way on this one?
To me, that interaction conveyed a remarkable willingness on the Judges part to question his own prior conclusions, and a remarkable eagerness to involve others in that process. And its an approach that Ive often felt myself returning to in my own career.
Previn Warren: I was always struck by the particular care with which he reviewed the submissions of pro se litigants. The Judge felt that his role was to be as neutral and fair as possible, which meant doing his best to understand the issueseven if they were presented in a rough and untutored way. When you review hundreds of briefs a year, it is easy to discount the ones that are riddled with spelling errors and presented in confusing prose. Judge Garland resisted that impulse at every turn.
That disciplined commitment made a deep impression on me; since clerking for the Judge I have maintained an active pro bono practice representing indigent prisoners in their civil appeals.
Kendall Turner: My work with Judge Garland made me realize that, no matter how busy one is, it is important to make time to help those less fortunate. I tutored at the same public elementary school as him because I figured that, if he had time to volunteer, so did I. In my current job, I devote a substantial amount of time to pro bono work for the same reason.
Eric Berger: Judge Garland had worked for many years in the Department of Justice. Though he never talked about this, we all knew that he could have made far more money had he remained a partner in a private law firm. But his years in the Justice Department meant a great deal to him, and he spoke often about his experience serving his country there.
After my clerkship, I took a job at the Washington, D.C. office of Jenner & Block. I selected Jenner in large part because of its great commitment to pro bono work, and that decision was certainly influenced by Judge Garlands example. And while at Jenner, I was fortunate to work on a number of pro bono cases involving issues such as the detention of foreign nationals at Guantanamo Bay, lethal injection, and prisoners rights, including a case in which a prisoner suffered from a botched operation.
Kendall Turner: The American people and Senate already know Judge Garland is smart and qualified. I want them to know that he is incredibly kind. Ive had a lot of great bosses in my life, but Judge Garland taught me the most about how to think, how to write, and how to be a good person all the while.
Josh Segal: The Judge takes a deeply respectful approach to disagreementnot just with other judges, but with litigants as well. Particularly after a spirited round of questioning at oral argument, he would ask his clerks whether he had treated counsel kindly, fairly, and respectfully. (Although we wouldnt have hesitated to say no, the answer was always yes.)
Eric Berger: Judge Garland is the epitome of a careful, fair, non-partisan judge. He never decides a case based on the identity of the parties or the politics surrounding a case. Instead, he impartially applies the law to the facts.
He is the fairest, most impartial person I know.

A guide to writing a letter to the editor
Choose an issue you want to write about and take a look at some suggested topics to help you get started. Its just a starting point, thoughmake your letter personal to you and your community.
NASA and 97% of scientists agree that climate change is real. Is your representative a climate change denier? Do you live in a coastal area that has experienced more frequent and more devastating storms in recent years? Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, and floods are all now more frequent and intense, and are projected to worsen in the future due to climate change. Has your community been impacted by extreme weather in recent years?
Help spread the word: This year's open enrollment period begins November 15th. Have you or someone you know recently received coverage in the health insurance marketplace? If so, explain why it's important to you that you and your loved ones have insurance. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, no one can be denied coverage ever again. Were you or someone you know previously denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition? Have you or someone you know recently visited a doctor for an annual checkup, vaccination, or mammogrampreventive care which is now free under Obamacare? Do you or someone you know have a child who can now benefit from staying on your health insurance until they turn 26, thanks to the new law? Under Obamacare, insurance companies can no longer set lifetime limits on your coverage. Do you or someone you know now benefit from this basic protection?
The impact of gun violence affects communities across the country every day. Has your community been affected by gun violence? Why is important to you that we close the loopholes in background checks to keep guns out of dangerous hands? 
 In 2013, a minority in the Senate blocked a common-sense, bipartisan bill that would've extended background checks for all gun sales, closing the dangerous loophole that allows guns to fall into the wrong hands. Despite their inaction, many states are taking action to expand background checks on their own. What should your state do to make progress to help prevent gun violence? Call on state leaders to act.
Despite support from both parties, the House of Representatives failed to act for over a year on a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate with a large bipartisan majority. President Obama took common-sense steps to fix our broken immigration system (learn more here). Why is this action important to you? The Presidents actions will grow the U.S. economy by $90 billion over the next 10 years, and protect our families and communities, focusing our law enforcement resources where they should be focused: on felons, not families. Do you know someone who will benefit from the President's actions to help fix our broken immigration system? A permanent comprehensive fix for our broken system can only come from Congress, but 11 presidents have acted 39 times to address immigration over the past 60 years. President Obama's common-sense steps fit into this long history of presidents using their authority to improve our immigration system. Why is it important to you to that Congress build on the President's actions and take steps to fix our broken system now?
According to the Economic Policy Institute, raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour would create 140,000 jobs and increase GDP by $33 billion. How would raising the minimum wage affect you and your family? In December 2013, Congress allowed unemployment insurance benefits to expire for 1.3 million workers who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. Each week that Congress fails to act, 72,000 more job seekers lose this crucial lifeline. Have you or someone you know lost unemployment insurance because of Congressional inaction?
Women working full-time make an average of only 77 cents for every dollar that a man makes. Have you or someone you know been impacted by this inequality? Almost 60% of minimum wage workers are women, and women are increasingly the primary breadwinners in American homes. Can you explain how an increase in minimum wage would help you or someone you know, or women and families generally? Only 51% of women have access to paid leave after having their first child. Can you explain why workplace policies that help women and familieslike paid family leaveare important to you? Approximately 40% of America's private-sector employees don't have access to sick leave to allow them to care for themselves, a sick parent or a sick child. Can you talk about your experience with sick leave and why it would be important to have a standard across workplaces?

How Ida Went Solar (And Why It Means You Can, Too)  The White House
In 1990, the electric company shut off power to Ida Rhynes home in Baltimore for the first time. They did it because she simply couldnt afford to pay her electrical bill.
After working as a bus driver for over a decade, she suffered an accident that put her on a partial disability pensionand left her without a regular income. She sometimes had to make the tough choice between feeding her family, making her mortgage, and paying the electric company.
You can probably guess which option she picked. And this meant that shes frequently lived in a house without power.
Last week, a team of people installed a set of brand new solar panels on her roofpanels that cost next-to-nothing upfront. Panels that she will be able to pay off, over time, through savings on her monthly energy bill.
Now, she says she wakes up every day and just cant stop smiling. She feels like her home looks good. A major, monthly expense no longer keeps her up at night. That frees her up to think about her kids and their futuresabout the future of her whole community.
Because while she says she is proud to be the first person on her block to have solar panels installed, she knows that she wont be the last. Solar panels are now within reach for millions of people in this country thanks to steps that President Obama has taken in the past eight years. Thats very exciting.
Statement by the President and the First Lady
Nancy Reagan once wrote that nothing could prepare you for living in the White House. She was right, of course. But we had a head start, because we were fortunate to benefit from her proud example, and her warm and generous advice.
Our former First Lady redefined the role in her time here. Later, in her long goodbye with President Reagan, she became a voice on behalf of millions of families going through the depleting, aching reality of Alzheimers, and took on a new role, as advocate, on behalf of treatments that hold the potential and the promise to improve and save lives.
We offer our sincere condolences to their children, Patti, Ron, and Michael, and to their grandchildren. And we remain grateful for Nancy Reagan's life, thankful for her guidance, and prayerful that she and her beloved husband are together again.

Texas-like abortion laws are already starting to fall after the Supreme Court's ruling
The Supreme Courts historic ruling in Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt struck down two anti-abortion laws in Texas, but its effects wont be limited to Texas. The day after the ruling, the Court declined to hear two other cases involving Texas-like anti-abortion laws in Mississippi and Wisconsin.
That means those two laws are done for. Lower courts ruled to block them, and the Court denied the appeals of those rulings.
And on Monday, Alabamas attorney general announced he was dropping legal appeals to uphold a similar law in that state.
As in Texas, Mississippi, Wisconsin, and Alabama all required doctors who provide abortions to have admitting privileges with a nearby hospital. And as in Texas, those laws threatened to shut down clinics  in Mississippis case, the last abortion clinic open in the state.
Admitting privileges laws are one example of what pro-choice advocates call TRAP laws, or targeted regulations of abortion providers, because they impose regulations on abortion doctors that dont apply to similar medical procedures. Often, those regulations are specifically designed to shut down abortion clinics.
As a federal judge explained when he struck down Wisconsins law last year, admitting privileges are particularly difficult for abortion providers to get. Hospitals typically require doctors with privileges to admit a certain number of patients a year. But because abortion is so safe, abortion providers almost never have to admit their patients to a hospital.
Wisconsin and Mississippi are likely just the first of many states whose Texas-like laws will be struck down after the Supreme Courts ruling, and Alabama probably wont be the only state to back off from obviously unconstitutional court challenges. But it probably wont mean the end of states fighting losing court battles on abortion laws.

Weekly Address: Its Time to Give Families Access to Paid Sick Leave
Michael Bloomberg: NRA used to support more background checks
"If you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done."
In back-to-back appearances on Meet the Press, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the NRAs Wayne LaPierre went another round in their duel over proposed gun legislation.
Bloomberg is pushing for universal background checks on all firearm purchases. LaPierre opposes expanded background checks. Both are working hard to discredit the other.
During Bloombergs segment, he told host David Gregory that once upon a time, LaPierre was in favor of the background checks hes now fighting.
"In fact, if you go back to 1999, Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done," Bloomberg said.
Were fact-checking statements by both Bloomberg and LaPierre from Meet the Press. Here, well examine the New York mayors characterization of what LaPierre said back in 1999.
On May 27, 1999, LaPierre testified before the House Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime. The Columbine High School shooting, in which 12 high school students and one teacher were murdered, had happened a month earlier.
To rebut what he saw as a demonization of the NRA and its members, LaPierre listed a number of actions and laws he said were good policy.
First on that list:
"We think it's reasonable to provide mandatory instant criminal background checks for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone," he said. "That means closing the Hinckley loophole so the records of those adjudicated mentally ill are in the system. This isn't new, or a change of position, or a concession. I've been on record on this point consistently, from our national meeting in Denver, to paid national ads and position papers, to news interviews and press appearances."
He also spoke in favor of preventing juvenile felons from ever owning guns, setting up instant background checks at gun shows and keeping schools gun-free.
New York magazine, in a January 2013 story, dug up the advertising campaign LaPierre mentioned in his testimony. Titled "Be reasonable," the NRA ads that ran in national newspapers said, "We think it's reasonable to provide for instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops. But what's unreasonable is how the proposed Lautenberg legislation ignores the 250,000 prohibited people, like felons, who've walked away from gun stores  instead of being prosecuted for a federal felony for trying to buy a gun."
We contacted the NRA for this story but did not receive a response about Bloombergs claim.
In January, NRA board member Sandy Froman told CNN, "The NRA has changed its position, and the reason it's changed its position is because the system doesn't work."
LaPierre himself acknowledged this change in a January 2013 Senate hearing in the wake of the Newtown, Conn., elementary school shooting.
"I do not believe the way the law is working now, unfortunately, that it does any good to extend the law to private sales between hobbyists and collectors.  The fact is, the law right now is a failure the way it's working," he said.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., then said, "I understand, back in 1999, you said no loopholes anywhere for anyone. But now you do not support background checks for all buyers of firearms?"
LaPierre responded: "I think the National Instant Check System, the way it's working now, is a failure. Because this administration is not prosecuting the people that they catch. Twenty-three states are not even putting the mental records of those adjudicated mentally incompetent into the system. Now, assume that if you don't prosecute, and they try to buy a gun, even if you catch them, and you let them walk away, to assume they're not going to get a gun -- they're criminals, they're homicidal maniacs, and they're mentally ill. I mean, we all know that homicidal maniacs, criminals and the insane ... don't abide by the law."
The NRAs website on March 12, 2013, posted its firm stance against expanding background checks:
"The NRA opposes criminalizing private firearms transfers between law-abiding individuals, and therefore opposes an expansion of the background check system."
Bloomberg said that in 1999, "Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done."
In congressional testimony following the Columbine High School shooting, LaPierre called it "reasonable" to conduct a background check "for every sale at every gun show. No loopholes anywhere for anyone." Subsequent statements by NRA officials acknowledge that the groups position has since changed to opposition to more background checks.

Well, as the Vice President put it, a lot of very, very important decisions are going unresolved by the shorthanded Supreme Court.
The Washington Posts editorial board noted recently that the judicial branch of government is not properly functioning, and has not been for months. And this report by the Constitutional Accountability Center documents the harm of an eight-member Supreme Court and the legal controversies that might arise from a 44 split. Even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agrees: Eight is not a good number.
As the Vice President went on to explain, the Supreme Court plays the central role in ruling on the constitutionality of federal laws when lower courts are divided.
Federal circuit courts of appeals around the country have ruled differently on a number of very important issues, he said. Without the ability of the federal courtthe Supreme Court of the United Statesto resolve those differences, you have an application of law different in one state from another.
Yes. In fact, President Obama said that Judge Garland may be the most qualified nominee that weve seen before the Senate for a Supreme Court seat.
But as Vice President Biden also noted, Judge Garland is a moderate pick who is respected by both sides of the aisle, with a long record of bipartisan support and a reputation as a consensus builder.
Here are just a few examples of that support from the other side of the aisle:
No. A recent legal study detailed the unprecedented nature of the GOPs opposition to hearings, while a blistering report released by Sen. Elizabeth Warrens office noted that Senate Republicans stance represents a failure to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities.
The Vice President implored the Senate to follow Article II of the Constitution and advise and consent on the nomination.
They cant remain silent, Biden said. They have to take a position.
Senate Republicans have blocked President Obamas judicial nominations throughout his presidencyas the report from Sen. Warrens office detailedand their extreme campaign has culminated in obstructing Judge Merrick Garlands Supreme Court nomination.
But opinion polls show that the American people want the Senate to hold hearings on the vacancy and believe GOP leadership is playing politics by refusing to consider Judge Garland. Republicans and Independents in swing states across the country are fed up with the partisan games and are speaking out, putting Senate Republicans in a difficult position.
Vice President Biden issued a call to action to continue the unrelenting public pressure on Senate Republicans to do their job and end the Supreme Court blockade.

Record-crushing October keeps Earth on track for hottest year in 2015
It was Earths warmest October ever recorded and it wasnt even close. The record-shattering month was right in step with most of the preceding months in 2015  which is positioned to easily rank as the warmest year on record.
New data from the Japan Meteorological Agency and NASA show that the planet obliterated October records established just last year. October 2015 out-baked October 2014 by 0.34 degrees (0.19 Celsius) and 0.32 degrees (0.18 Celsius) in JMA and NASAs analyses, respectively.
And these records are breaking records.
The planets temperature departure from the long-term average of 1.04 Celsius in October is the greatest of any month ever recorded by NASA. It marked the first time a monthly temperature anomalyexceeded 1 degrees Celsius in records dating back to 1880. The previouslargest anomaly was 0.97 Celsius fromJanuary, 2007.
The toasty October put another exclamation mark on a year that has essentially locked up the title of warmest on record.
In August, the Earths average temperature was running so far ahead of 2014, the previous warmest year, that NOAA said there was 97 percent chance 2015would surpass it.
Then, the planet recorded its warmest September ever recorded by an unprecedented margin.
[After record-shattering September, 2015 in commanding lead for Earths hottest year on record]
Earlier this month, Britains weather service, the Met Office, and NASA both stated that the Earths average temperature is likely to rise 1 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels for the first time by the end of this year. This milestone is significant since it marks the halfway point to two degrees Celsius, the internationally accepted limit for avoiding the worst consequences of climate change.
[The world is off course to prevent two degrees C of warming, says energy agency]
Temperatures have trended upward over the last several decades, spurred by increasing and unrelenting emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, since the spring, a strengthening El Nio event, which is now near record levels, has bumped this years temperatures to all-time highs.
[By one measure, this wicked El Nio is the strongest ever recorded: What it means]
El Nio events release vast amounts of heat from the tropical Pacific into the atmosphere. This years event is near its peak and may begin to weaken soon, but is expected to remain strong into the winter, likely keeping global average temperatures above or at least very near previous record levels.

The Majority of the New Energy Capacity Added to U.S. Grids Was Renewable
Renewable energy accounted for the majority of new power added to the U.S. power grids last yearmarking the second year in a row that clean energy surpassed fossil fuels, according to a new report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy.
Renewable energy has enjoyed a boost from government incentives and declining systems costs.
Clean energy investments also rose 7.5% from the year before to $56 billion. Ten years earlier, in 2005, renewable investments barely amounted to more than $15 billion. More than half of last years amount went toward solar energy projects, while wind attracted $11.6 billion in investments.
Corporate procurement of clean energy contined to grow: It doubled from 2013 to 2014 and again from 2014 to 2015. Major corporate buyers included tech giants Google goog , Amazon amzn , Facebook fb , and Apple aapl .
Coal, meanwhile, emerged as the main loser of the year. As a record number of coal plants closed, domestic coal production continued its steady decline since 2008, according to the Energy Information Administration.

February breaks global temperature records by 'shocking' amount
February smashed a century of global temperature records by a stunning margin, according to data released by Nasa.
The unprecedented leap led scientists, usually wary of highlighting a single months temperature, to label the new record a shocker and warn of a climate emergency.
The Nasa data shows the average global surface temperature in February was 1.35C warmer than the average temperature for the month between 1951-1980, a far bigger margin than ever seen before. The previous record, set just one month earlier in January, was 1.15C above the long-term average for that month.
Nasa dropped a bombshell of a climate report, said Jeff Masters and Bob Henson, who analysed the data on the Weather Underground website. February dispensed with the one-month-old record by a full 0.21C  an extraordinary margin to beat a monthly world temperature record by.
This result is a true shocker, and yet another reminder of the incessant long-term rise in global temperature resulting from human-produced greenhouse gases, said Masters and Henson. We are now hurtling at a frightening pace toward the globally agreed maximum of 2C warming over pre-industrial levels.
The UN climate summit in Paris in December confirmed 2C as the danger limit for global warming which should not be passed. But it also agreed agreed to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5C, a target now looking highly optimistic.
Climate change is usually assessed over years and decades, and 2015 shattered the record set in 2014 for the hottest year seen, in data stretching back to 1850. The UK Met Office also expects 2016 to set a new record, meaning the global temperature record will have been broken for three years in a row.
One of the worlds three key temperature records is kept by Nasas Goddard Institute for Space Studies (Giss) and its director Prof Gavin Schmidt reacted to the February Giss temperature measurements with a simple wow. He tweeted:
We are in a kind of climate emergency now, said Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research in Germany. He told Fairfax Media: This is really quite stunning ... its completely unprecedented.
This is a very worrying result, said Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, noting that each of the last five months globally have been hotter than any month preceding them.
These results suggest that we may be even closer than we realised to breaching the [2C] limit. We have used up all of our room for manoeuvre. If we delay any longer strong cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, it looks like global mean surface temperature is likely to exceed the level beyond which the impacts of climate change are likely to be very dangerous.
A major El Nio event, the biggest since 1998, is boosting global temperatures, but scientists are agreed that global warming driven by humanitys greenhouse gas emissions is by far the largest factor in the astonishing run of temperature records.
Prof Adam Scaife, at the UK Met Office, said the very low levels of Arctic ice were also helping to raise temperatures: There has been record low ice in the Arctic for two months running and that releases a lot of heat. He said the Met Office had forecast a record-breaking 2016 in December: It is not as if you cant see these things coming.
Ed Hawkins, a climate scientist at the University of Reading, UK, said: It is a pretty big jump between January and February, although this data from Nasa is only the first set of global temperature data. We will need to see what the figures from NOAA and the Met Office say. It is in line with our expectations that due to the continuing effect of greenhouse gas emissions, combined with the effects of El Nio on top, 2016 is likely to beat 2015 as the warmest year on record.
The record for an annual increase of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, was also demolished in 2015.
Fossil fuel-burning and the strong El Nio pushed CO2 levels up by 3.05 parts per million (ppm) to 402.6 ppm compared to 2014. CO2 levels are increasing faster than they have in hundreds of thousands of years, said Pieter Tans, lead scientist at Noaas Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network. Its explosive compared to natural processes.

There's a $2 Trillion GDP Boost in Shrinking the U.S. Gender Gap
Improving gender equality would add at least $2.1 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product by 2025, according to a McKinsey Global Institute study, a boost roughly the size of the Texas economy.
We were surprised that there was such a large economic opportunity still at stake because the U.S. is a relative leader in gender parity, said Kweilin Ellingrud, a McKinsey partner and author of the study. The consulting firm in September said the global economy would gain $28 trillion in GDP with full gender equality.
While completely erasing the gender gap would add $4.3 trillion to U.S. GDP, Ellingrud said the $2.1 trillionrepresents more realistic progress. The smaller figure assumes each U.S. state improves at the same rate as the most-improved state in the previous 10 years. The study looked at 10 indicators, from the number of women in managerial and technical jobs to political leadership to violence against women.
McKinsey estimated that about 38 percent of the projected GDP gain would come from supporting womens labor-force participation. Currently, 57 percent of women are working, compared with 69 percent of men, Ellingrud said.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics expects the proportion of women in their prime working years -- ages 25 to 54 -- to decline by about two percentage points over the next decade as younger women seek more education and older ones drop out of the labor force. McKinseys $2.1 trillion scenario would require keeping 25-to-54 year old female participation unchanged at 74 percent.
Another 32 percent of the GDP gain would result from trimming the gap between women and men working full time. Women now hold 42 percent of full-time jobs and 64 percent of part-time jobs. The remaining increase would come from more women in higher paid sectors, such as health care services or advanced manufacturing.
The overall economic lift could add 6.4 million U.S. jobs, McKinsey said.
Researchers are increasingly putting a dollar value on gender inequality and focusing on the financial benefits of equal pay and paid family leave. The gender pay disparity in the U.S. costs the average woman about $430,000 in lost income over the course of her career, the National Womens Law Center, a nonprofit advocacy group, said earlier this week.
Ellingrud said that states cant fully capitalize on their share of the GDP growth unless they tackle the societal impacts as well.
In the new study, McKinsey added two research categories it didnt use in the global report that examined 95 countries-- single motherhood and teen pregnancy. One quarter of U.S. children are being raised without a father and 45 percent of those live below the poverty line, Ellingrud said.
Of 1.6 million U.S. children born out of wedlock each year, about 15 percent are to teen moms. The teen pregnancy rate in the U.S. is about the same as the child marriage rate in Uzbekistan, Djibouti and Botswana, she said.
Those categories sap opportunity for U.S. women, Ellingrud said. Teenage mothers tend to miss out on education, while unwed mothers, even if employed, often lack the time and support to develop skills that lead to higher paying jobs. The report didnt put a specific dollar number on those factors.
McKinsey ranked U.S. gender inequality high or extremely high in four other areas: women in management; political representation; violence against women and unpaid care. The U.S. is the only developed country that doesnt mandate paid parental leave. Some states are stepping in, including New York, where Governor Andrew Cuomo included mandatory paid leave in his budget last month.
U.S. inequality is less pronounced in professional or technical jobs, and in maternal mortality, the report said. Women outperform men in higher education.
All 50 states would gain at least 5 percent in GDP by 2025 if they were able to match best-in-class performance, Ellingrud said. Half the states would gain 10 percent or more, among them New York, Massachusetts and Michigan.
The study graded the 50 largest U.S. cities -- which generate 65 percent of the countrys GDP -- on a slightly different group of criteria, and found Baltimore and Atlanta had the highest level of gender equality. Baltimore was helped by having more women in political power and in the labor force, while Atlanta did well on gender parity in professional and technical jobs.
Cities cannot afford to ignore the imperative to build more inclusive and equal societies, the report said.

A Trade Deal for Working Families
As president, my top priority is to grow our economy and strengthen the middle class. When I took office, America was in the middle of the worst recession since the Great Depression -- but thanks to the hard work and resilience of the American people, our businesses have created 13.5 million jobs over the past 68 months, the longest streak of private-sector job creation in history. The unemployment rate has been cut nearly in half -- lower than its been in more than seven years.We have come back further and faster from recession than nearly every other advanced nation on Earth.
Thats real progress. But as any middle-class family will tell you, we have more to do. Thats why I believe the Trans-Pacific Partnership is so important. Its a trade deal that helps working families get ahead.
At a time when 95 percent of our potential customers live outside our borders, this agreement will open up new markets to made-in-America goods and services. Today, exports support 11.7 million American jobs. Companies that sell their goods around the world tend to grow faster, hire more employees and pay higher salaries than companies that dont. On average, export-supported jobs pay up to 18 percent more than other jobs.
These are good jobs -- and this agreement will lead to even more of them. It would eliminate more than 18,000 taxes that various countries put on made-in-America products.For instance, last year, we exported $89 billion in automotive products alone to TPP countries, many of which have soaring tariffs -- more than 70 percent in some cases -- on made-in-America products. Our farmers and ranchers, whose exports account for roughly 20 percent of all farm income, face similarly high tariffs. Thanks to the TPP, those taxes will drop drastically, most of them to zero. That means more U.S. exports supporting more higher-paying American jobs.
At a time when our workers too often face an unfair playing field, this agreement also includes the highest labor standards of any trade deal in history. Provisions protecting worker safety and prohibiting child labor make sure that businesses abroad play by the same kinds of rules we have here at home. Provisions protecting the environment and combating wildlife trafficking make sure that economic growth doesnt come at the expense of the only planet we call home. And these commitments are enforceable -- meaning we can hold other countries accountable through trade sanctions if they dont follow through. So, these tough new rules level the playing field, and when American workers have a fair chance to compete, I believe theyll win every time.
Ive said many times that the Trans-Pacific Partnership is the right thing for our economy, for working Americans and for our middle class. But Im not asking you to take my word for it. Instead, Ive posted the agreement online. If you build cars in places such as Detroit, you can see for yourself how your products will have a better shot of hitting the road in places such as Japan. If youre a farmer or rancher, youll see how your products will face fewer barriers abroad. If youre a small-business owner, youll see how this agreement will mean less paperwork and less red tape.
Along with the text of the agreement, we've posted detailed materials to help explain it. Its an unprecedented degree of transparency -- and its the right thing to do. Not every American will support this deal, and neither will every member of Congress. But I believe that in the end, the American people will see that it is a win for our workers, our businesses and our middle class.And I expect that, after the American people and Congress have an opportunity for months of careful review and consultation, Congress will approve it, and Ill have the chance to sign it into law.
Together, weve overcome enormous obstacles over the past seven years. Weve taken an economy that was in free fall and returned it to steady growth and job creation. And weve put ourselves in a position to restore Americas promise not only now, but for decades to come. Thats what I believe this agreement will help us do.

#UnitedOnClimate starts at home
Paul G. and the volunteers of OFA-Wisconsin have something to say about climate change. Like so many of us, theyve been critical contributors to the fight for a better climate future, and recently they raised their voices to thank a local leader for the work hes been doing.Over the last ten years, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett has installed renewable energy sources in city buildings, committed the city to studying and reducing its CO2 emissions, and put Milwaukee at the forefront of municipal climate progress. Wisconsin volunteers, together with local partners including the Sierra Club and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee School of Nursing, thanked the mayor for his efforts at a press conference atop the Milwaukee Public Library last week.Progress at the municipal level matters because cities account for 70 percent of worldwide carbon pollutionand theyre vulnerable to the worst risks of climate change. Thats why Milwaukee is also now part of the Compact of Mayors, an international coalition of hundreds of cities whose citizens understand that fighting climate change is too important to wait.Where did many of these ideas originally come from? Amazingly, it was really a group of citizens who stepped forward with  a lot of the recommendations that the city has acted on, the mayor told local reporters. His remarks at the press conference repeatedly highlighted the influence of Milwaukees community of local activists, and Barrett called the citys climate action truly a grassroots effort.All eyes are on the climate talks happening in Paris right now, and with good reason: The international community is hard at work setting an ambitious global agenda to fight climate change that will shape this work for years to come. But the negotiators in Paris cant do the work for us, and thats why the Wisconsin team scheduled their press conference for the opening day of the talks. As Paul said at the event, We must not forget the power we have locally.Thats why grassroots organizing is so important to this cause. Together we can educate and activate our friends and neighbors to take actionand mobilize cities across the country to follow Milwaukees example.Ready to join the conversation on climate change?

Up Next for Obamacare: Transforming Medicine
When President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, six years ago this week, he addressed the rancor the health-care debate had inspired with a call to resist cynicism. We are not a nation that does whats easy," he said. "We are a nation that does what is hard.What is necessary. What is right. Here, in this country, we shape our own destiny.
It hasnt been easy, and there have been challenges along the way, but we have made significant progress. Today, 20 million people have gained coverage because of the health law.Health-care prices have risen at the slowest rate in five decades. And with new protections and benefits, everyones insurance is higher quality, no matter where its purchased.
Today, thanks to the law, families across the country can get preventive care at no extra cost. They no longer have to worry about annual or lifetime caps on coverage. And they no longer have to worry about being denied insurance because they survived cancer or live with a chronic condition.
These gains are historic, but health-care reform has always been about more than insurance. Its also about building a health care system that puts patients in the center and works better for all Americans.
We have some of the best doctors in the world, but with high costs, uncoordinated care and a complex and confusing system, many Americans, both insured and uninsured, have been unsatisfied with their health-care experience.
Fortunately, the health-care law gave us new tools to improve how we deliver care and encourage innovation.
Imagine your sister needs knee surgery. From the emergency room to surgery, to recovery and a physical therapist, she meets with dozens of doctors, nurses and specialists. Right now, most insurance pays for each test, treatment or procedure separately. So everyone is focused solely on their role, not on working together. Without communication, they might order the same X-ray or blood test twice, and your sister may have to pay. And they might not have the time to sit down and make sure she understands how to avoid reinjuring her knee.
This kind of care doesnt prioritize quality, leaving us with higher costs. Thanks to the health law, were moving to a system that thinks of care in terms of how good, not how much.
If your sister were a patient in certain medical practices today, her doctors would work as a team. Her ER doctors would electronically share her X-rays with orthopedic specialists. Her family physician would tell her physical therapist about her asthma. Her nurses would take the time to make sure she understands her treatments. And a care coordinator would remind her about her follow-up care.
The federal government is working to make this patient-centered care the norm, not the exception. Were getting there in three ways.
First, we are changing how we pay doctors, so they can focus on the quality of care they provide, not the quantity of services they order. The health law created the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, focusing on alternative payment models that do just that. For instance, we announced a new payment model last year that creates one payment for a hip or joint replacement and recovery, rather than dozens of payments for each individual service.
The administration recently met its goal to tie 30 percent of Medicare payments to these kinds of models, and were also working to find smarter ways to pay for drugs.
Next, we are improving care, by encouraging better coordination and prioritizing wellness and prevention. If we can avoid illnesses before they happen, we can improve lives and save money. By encouraging best practices and reducing the injuries and infections patients acquire at hospitals, we have saved an estimated 87,000 lives and nearly $20 billion in cost savings.
Finally, we are unlocking health-care data. With information that can move where its needed, we can give doctors what they need to provide the best possible care and empower patients. Were working with some of the biggest, most influential names in health care, including the Hospital Corporation of America, the American Medical Association and Epic Systems Corp., to increase consumer access and implement shared standards to put health data to work.
This kind of system means better care, where doctors work together and have a full understanding of patients needs. Its smarter, where we pay for what works and spend our money more wisely. And its healthier, with engaged and empowered patients who lift up the health of our whole country.
Progress isnt easy, but what we have accomplished in six short years is undeniable: 20 million now covered, billions of dollars saved and changes that are making our system work better for everyone. We are beginning to transform our health care system in ways that are changing peoples lives for the better, and the health law that has put us on this path.
And this is hardly the end. We will continue to use tools created by the law to build a better, smarter, healthier system -- a system that puts people at its center. Not because it is easy, but because it is necessary and because it is right.

Jobless Claims at 42-Year Low as U.S. Employers Shun Firings
Filings for U.S. unemployment benefits were at a four-decade low over the past two weeks as sales prospects encouraged employers to maintain headcounts.
Jobless claims were 246,000 in the period ended Oct. 8, unchanged from the previous weeks level, which was revised lower, a Labor Department report showed Thursday in Washington. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called for 253,000. The four-week average also fell to the lowest level since 1973.
Employers remain reluctant to lay off workers as the pool of potential job candidates dries up and openings remain near record highs, making conditions ripe for wage gains that may spur Federal Reserve policy makers to raise interest rates by years end. Filings have been below 300,000 for 84 straight weeks -- the longest streak since 1970 and a level typical for a healthy labor market.
These numbers are really remarkable given that the labor force is obviously a lot bigger than it was in 1973, said Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. They tell us of a relatively healthy labor market.
At the same time, even though claims are down, theres still slack in the labor market, Newport said.
Total filings in each of the last two weeks were the lowest since November 1973.
Estimates in the Bloomberg survey ranged from 240,000 to 270,000. The Labor Department revised the prior weeks reading from an initially reported 249,000.
The four-week average of claims, a less-volatile measure than the weekly figure, declined to 249,250 from 252,750 in the prior week.
The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits fell by 16,000 to 2.05 million in the week ended Oct. 1, the lowest since June 2000. The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits held at 1.5 percent. These data are reported with a one-week lag.
While there was nothing unusual in the data, two states -- Louisiana and Virginia -- had estimated jobless claims last week, according to the Labor Department.
States such as Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas may see a pickup in applications for benefits in coming weeks after Hurricane Matthew. Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. project a 10,000 gain in the week ending Oct. 15 as workers displaced by the storm begin to file.
Matthew moved up the Florida coastline on Oct. 7 before making landfall in South Carolina the following day and continuing on to North Carolina, causing flooding and power outages along the way.

HHS says patient safety efforts have saved 87,000 lives, $20 billion
This post has been updated.
Patient safety measures that reward hospitals for reducing preventable infections, pressure ulcers and adverse drug reactions have resulted in a 17 percent decline in these types of patient harms between 2010 and 2014, according to a federal report released Tuesday.
The measures were put in place by the Affordable Care Act. Preliminary estimates by the Department of Health and Human Services show 87,000 fewer patients died in hospitals and nearly $20 billion in health care costs were saved as a result of a reduction in these harms, known as hospital-acquired conditions, during that four-year period.
The precise causes of the cumulative decline are not fully understood, the report said. But a number of public and private health-care initiatives have been put in place in the past four years that reward or penalize hospitals based on how they perform on a variety of patient quality and safety measures.
[At top U.S. hospital, almost 50 percent of surgeries have drug-related error]
"Patients in America's hospitals are safer today as a result of this partnership with hospitals and health care providers," said HHS Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell in a statement.
Hospital-acquired conditions include falls, adverse drug events, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central line associatedbloodstream infections, pressure ulcers, and surgical site infections, among others. HHSanalyzed the incidence of a number of avoidable hospital-acquired conditions compared to 2010 rates.
Although the rate has dropped since 2010, it remained steady from 2013 to 2014, which researchers said showed that "much work remains to be done." That means in2013 and 2014, almost 10 percent of hospitalized patients experienced one or more of the patient harms described, a rate the report said "is still too high." Most of the deaths averted occurred as a result of reductions in the rates of pressure ulcers and adverse drug events, the report said.
One notable exception was falls, which occurred at the same rate in 2014 as in 2010.
"Falls are a double-edged sword," said Richard Kronick, director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the HHS agency that prepared Tuesday's report. No one knows for sure, he said, but one hypothesis is that hospitalized patients are encouraged to get out of bed and move around to improve their recovery, but that also increases the likelihood of falls.
Blame the "bug," not the rug. The surprising reason some people fall.
Researchers said they used the "complex relationship between hospital-acquired conditions and mortality" to extrapolate the impact on deaths averted and cost savings.

Weekly Address: Affordable Care Act is Making a Difference for Millions of Americans
Barack Obama: Why we must rethink solitary confinement
In 2010, a 16-year-old named Kalief Browder from the Bronx was accused of stealing a backpack. He was sent to Rikers Island to await trial, where he reportedly endured unspeakable violence at the hands of inmates and guards  and spent nearly two years in solitary confinement.
In 2013, Kalief was released, having never stood trial. He completed a successful semester at Bronx Community College. But life was a constant struggle to recover from the trauma of being locked up alone for 23 hours a day. One Saturday, he committed suicide at home. He was just 22 years old.
Solitary confinement gained popularity in the United States in the early 1800s, and the rationale for its use has varied over time. Today, its increasingly overused on people such as Kalief, with heartbreaking results  which is why my administration is taking steps to address this problem.
There are as many as 100,000 people held in solitary confinement in U.S. prisons  including juveniles and people with mental illnesses. As many as 25,000 inmates are serving months, even years of their sentences alone in a tiny cell, with almost no human contact.
Research suggests that solitary confinement has the potential to lead to devastating, lasting psychological consequences. It has been linked to depression, alienation, withdrawal, a reduced ability to interact with others and the potential for violent behavior. Some studies indicate that it can worsen existing mental illnesses and even trigger new ones. Prisoners in solitary are more likely to commit suicide, especially juveniles and people with mental illnesses.
The United States is a nation of second chances, but the experience of solitary confinement too often undercuts that second chance. Those who do make it out often have trouble holding down jobs, reuniting with family and becoming productive members of society. Imagine having served your time and then being unable to hand change over to a customer or look your wife in the eye or hug your children.
As president, my most important job is to keep the American people safe. And since I took office, overall crime rates have decreased by more than 15percent. In our criminal justice system, the punishment should fit the crime  and those who have served their time should leave prison ready to become productive members of society. How can we subject prisoners to unnecessary solitary confinement, knowing its effects, and then expect them to return to our communities as whole people? It doesnt make us safer. Its an affront to our common humanity.
Thats why last summer, I directed Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and the Justice Department to review the overuse of solitary confinement across U.S. prisons. They found that there are circumstances when solitary is a necessary tool, such as when certain prisoners must be isolated for their own protection or in order to protect staff and other inmates. In those cases, the practice should be limited, applied with constraints and used only as a measure of last resort. They have identified common-sense principles that should guide the use of solitary confinement in our criminal justice system.
The Justice Department has completed its review, and I am adopting its recommendations to reform the federal prison system. These include banning solitary confinement for juveniles and as a response to low-level infractions, expanding treatment for the mentally ill and increasing the amount of time inmates in solitary can spend outside of their cells. These steps will affect some 10,000 federal prisoners held in solitary confinement  and hopefully serve as a model for state and local corrections systems. And I will direct all relevant federal agencies to review these principles and report back to me with a plan to address their use of solitary confinement.
[More coverage: Obama bans solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons]
States that have led the way are already seeing positive results. Colorado cut the number of people in solitary confinement, and assaults against staff are the lowest theyve been since 2006. New Mexico implemented reforms and has seen a drop in solitary confinement, with more prisoners engaging in promising rehabilitation programs. And since 2012, federal prisons have cut the use of solitary confinement by 25 percent and significantly reduced assaults on staff.
Reforming solitary confinement is just one part of a broader bipartisan push for criminal justice reform. Every year, we spend $80 billion to keep 2.2million people incarcerated. Many criminals belong behind bars. But too many others, especially nonviolent drug offenders, are serving unnecessarily long sentences. Thats why members of Congress in both parties are pushing for change, from reforming sentencing laws to expanding reentry programs to give those who have paid their debt to society the tools they need to become productive members of their communities. And I hope they will send me legislation as soon as possible that makes our criminal justice system smarter, fairer, less expensive and more effective.
In America, we believe in redemption. We believe, in the words of Pope Francis, that every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes. We believe that when people make mistakes, they deserve the opportunity to remake their lives. And if we can give them the hope of a better future, and a way to get back on their feet, then we will leave our children with a country that is safer, stronger and worthy of our highest ideals.

Obama announces moratorium on new federal coal leases
The Obama administration on Friday ordered a moratorium on new leases for coal mined from federal lands as part of a sweeping review of the governments management of vast amounts of taxpayer-owned coal throughout the West.
Interior Secretary Sally Jewellannounced the temporary halt,saying it was time for a re-examination of the decades-old coal-leasing program, fromhealth and environmental impacts to whether U.S. citizens are getting a fair return for the hundreds of millions of tons of government-owned coal that are mined and sold each year.
It is abundantly clear that times are different in the energy sector now than they were 30 years ago, and we must undertake a review and thats what we need to do as responsible stewards of the nations assets, Jewell said in a conference call with reporters. That was a time, 30 years ago, when our nation had very different priorities and needs. The result was a federal coal program designed to get as much coal out of the ground as possible, and in many ways thats the program that weve been operating ever since.
The announcement, initially reported late Thursday, comes three days after President Obama hinted of comingreforms to federal energy policy in his State of the Union address.
[How the United States exports its greenhouse gas emissions  as coal.]
The decision was cheered by environmentalists but denounced by industry groups and politicians from Western states, where federal coal leases provide thousands of jobs as well as revenue for state and local government coffers. Obama administration officials have been debating such a change for years, sayingcurrent practices contribute to aglaring contradiction in U.S. energy policy, which simultaneously promotes the sale of federally owned coal even as it seeks to limit greenhouse-gas pollution from coal burning.
Interior Department officials said the review would take the form of a Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement, which allows a broader look at all aspects of federal coal leasing across regions and can incorporate environmental and health impacts as well as financial ones. The last review on this scale occurred in the 1980s.
U.S. officials say the moves will not immediately affect production or jobs, as current federal leases produce enough coal to supply the countrys needs for 20 years. Jewell said exceptions to the new-lease moratorium could be granted to ensure adequate production of metallurgical coal used in steel production, or to allow small modifications to existing leases.
Well makeaccommodationsin the event ofemergency circumstances to ensurethis pausewill havenomaterialimpact on the nations ability to meet itspower generationneeds, Jewell said. We are undertaking this effort with full consideration of the importance of maintaining reliable and affordable energy for American families and businesses, as well other federal programs and policies.
Peabody Energy spokeswoman Kelley Wright said in an email that the decision will not deliver a serious blow to the company, but was still misguided.
Thanks to Peabodys investments over time, we have more than 20 years of production through our superior Powder River Basin coal reserve position, representing long-term security of supply and a competitive strength, she said. Nonetheless, the Administrations actions represent poor policy and a flawed way to accomplish carbon goals.The way to a lower-carbon future is through technology, not by attempting to deprive Americans of the low cost reliable electricity that coal represents.
Hundreds of millions of tons of federally owned coal are mined by private companies each year under laws requiring the federal government to seek maximum benefitfor resources on public lands. Environmental groups and some independent analysts have long argued that taxpayers are under-compensated for coal extracted from vast mines on federally owned land across the West, and that prices do not reflect societal costs from pollution from coal-burning.
In his speech on Tuesday, Obama argued for decreasing reliance on fossil fuels as part of the larger effort to fight the causes of climate change. He said the administration would push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet. The administration has supported policies that have led to rapid growth of solar and wind energy, which are now cost-competitive with coal and other fossil fuels in some parts of the country. Nationally, morepeople now work in the solar industry than in coal mines.
But several business associations immediately attacked the move, which the U.S. Chamber of Commerce decried as a foolish crusade.
Another day, another front on the war on coal from this administration, said Karen Harbert, president of the Chambers Institute for 21st Century Energy. At this point, it is obvious that the President and his administration wont be satisfied until coal is completely eradicated from our energy mix.
[Oil just dropped below $30 a barrel  again.]
A number of key Congressional Republicans also criticized the decision, saying it would weakenthe economy and harm workers in coal states.
We should be putting our nation on the path of continued energy strength, not undermining our energy security, said Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah), chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources. Unfortunately the presidents bid to solidify his legacy with the extreme left will come at the expense of Americas energy needs and will make the lives of people more expensive and more uncomfortable.
House Speaker Paul Ryan vowed to fight the administrations plans to keep more of the nations coal underground. Coal on federal land belongs to all Americans, but the president is denying people access to their own abundant, low-cost energy source.
This is a major shift that helps modernize the federal coal program, said Jayni Hein, policy director at the Institute for Policy Integrity. This planning process will disclose the environmental and social impacts of coal leasing, which are extensive.
Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune said in an interview that the decision represented a fundamental shift in how the federal government had begun to operate, by curbing the supply of fossil fuels available for burning rather than just working to reduce overall demand. He noted that when Obama rejected the cross-border permit application to build the Keystone XL pipeline late last year, the president specifically said that part of his reasoning stemmed from the fact that governments have got to keep some of the worlds remaining fossil fuels locked in the ground.
If Keystone was the kickoff, then this was a 50-yard downfield pass that helps us score a touchdown, Brune said. For years weve been arguing we need to combine action on our tailpipes and smokestacks with a supply-side strategy to keep dirty fuels in the ground, and in the last few months weve made tremendous progress.
Mining companies currently pay a 12.5percentroyalty rate for coal taken from surface mines, compared to an18.75percentroyalty for oil and gas from offshore drilling. Coal companies say the actual rates paid to the government are much higher because of bonuses and other fees paid through lease agreements.
Most of the coal mined from federal lands is used in U.S. electricity generation, though some is sold overseas. Government-owned coal harvested in the Powder River basinthe countrys biggest coal-producing region, straddling Wyoming and Montanaaccounts for about 10 percent of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to a study last year by the Center for American Progress and the Wilderness Society.
The federal coal program is frozen in time in the 1980s, said David Hayes, a former Interior Department deputy secretary and senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. The current rules, which were written when you could still smoke on airplanes and dump sewage in the ocean, neither deliver a fair return to taxpayers nor account for the pollution costs that result from coal mining.
Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), who ordered the first Government Accountability Office report on the program in the early 1980s, which led to the resignation of then-Interior Secretary James Watt, said it took multiple factors to finally get the administration to overhaul the leasing system.
Its been on autopilot for decades, and weve finally been able to find the combination of taxpayers getting shortchanged with impacts on climate to finally break through to have a set of solutions be put in place, he said in an interview.

US wind energy output hit record in '15, industry group says
BRIGHTON, Colo. (AP)  Wind energy generated a record 191 megawatt-hours of electricity last year, enough for 17.5 million homes, an industry group said Tuesday.
The American Wind Energy Association said wind produced 4.7 percent of the nation's electricity in 2015. Coal generated 33 percent and natural gas slightly less than that, the association said.
The association released the statistics at a Vestas Wind Systems turbine plant in Brighton, Colorado, near Denver.
Demand for wind energy is also driving up employment. The industry employed the equivalent of 88,000 full-time workers last year, up 20 percent in a year, the report said.
"We need wind technicians to keep these machines running smoothly," Tom Kiernan, CEO of the association, said at a news conference.
Chris Brown, president of Vestas America, said it can be difficult to find qualified workers.
Starting pay for wind technicians is about $25 an hour, said Auston Van Slyke, wind energy technology director for Ecotech Institute in Aurora, a private school that trains workers for the renewable energy industry.
Texas remains No. 1 for wind energy while Iowa is second. Iowa generated more than 30 percent of its electricity from wind last year, a record for any state, the report said.
The group said tax breaks extended by Congress last year will help stabilize the industry.
Xcel Energy announced Tuesday it plans to build Colorado's largest wind farm in the eastern part of the state, with enough turbines to generate 600 megawatts of electricity.
David Eves, president of Xcel's Colorado operation, said the wind farm would occupy land in several counties but declined to say which ones. He also declined to say how much it would cost.
He said more details would come in May.

Commutations
Our nation faces a cycle of poverty, criminality, and incarceration that traps too many Americans and weakens too many communities. Since taking office, President Obama has fought for a smarter and more equitable criminal justice system. He has been committed to using all the tools at his disposal to remedy the unfairness at the heart of the systemincluding the presidential power to grant clemency.
The President has now commuted the sentences of 774 men and women incarcerated under outdated and unduly harsh sentencing laws, including 266 individuals who were serving life sentences. The majority were nonviolent offenders sentenced for drug crimes. To date, the President has granted commutations to more prisoners than the past 11 presidents combined. He has also granted 70 pardons and is committed to continuing to grant additional commutations and pardons throughout the remainder of his presidency.
At the same time, President Obama knows that clemency alone cannot fix decades of overly punitive sentencing policies, or make our criminal justice system more fair and more just on the whole. That's why his Administration has worked to enhance fairness and efficiency at all phases of the criminal justice system.
Solar energy is poised for an unforgettable year
New statisticsjust released by the U.S. Energy Information Administration suggest that in the coming year, the booming solar sector will add more new electricity-generating capacity than any other  including natural gas and wind.
EIA reports that planned installations for 2016 include 9.5 gigawatts of utility-scale solar  followed by 8 gigawatts (or 8 billion watts) of natural gas and 6.8 gigawatts of wind. This suggests solar could truly blow out the competition, because the EIA numbers are only for large or utility-scale solar arrays or farms and do not include fast-growing rooftop solar, which will also surely add several additional gigawatts of capacity in 2016.
In other words, U.S. solar seems poised for not just a record year but perhaps a blowout year. Last year, in contrast, solar set a new record with7.3 gigawattsof total new photovoltaic capacity across residential, commercial, and utility scale installations.
[These states are setting wind energy records  and suing over Obamas climate plans]
If actual additions ultimately reflect these plans, 2016 will be the first year in which utility-scale solar additions exceed additions from any other single energy source, says EIA.
Justin Baca, vice president for markets and research at the Solar Energy Industries Association, told the Post that he agrees with EIAs figures  though the industry group expresses them in direct current (DC) versus alternating current (AC), and so projects a total of 11.8 gigawatts of utility-scale solar photovoltaic installations, a number Baca calls completely consistent with EIAs. On top of that, meanwhile, SEIA expects to see an additional 4 gigawatts of residential and commercial solar additions, for over 15 gigawatts in total, Baca said.
Solars going to be the decisive leader in terms of capacity additions, for 2016, Baca said.
The reason this is occurring, however, is not a simple reflection of solars growing popularity, or its widely agreed upon role in helping to battle climate change. Rather, it involves that darling of the industry, the 30 percent solarinvestment tax credit, which was extended late last year for five years, with a gradual phaseout.
Before its recent extension, the credit was set to phase out at the end of 2016. Accordingly, to make sure they captured the credit, a large number of installations had been planned to close by the end of this year.
For the past eight years, the expectation had been that you were going to get your system done this year, otherwise the cost of the system in 2017 was going to be much higher, Baca said. Now that the credit will actually not phase out, many of those already planned installations are going ahead on time. Hadthe tax credits been extended earlier, people might have relaxed their timelines, he said.
This logic means that 2017 wont see as many installations as 2016  but Baca thinks the industry will keep growing and that by 2019, will climb back to 2016s high.
However, given the extensionof the credit, it could be that 2016 actually ends a little lower than it would have otherwise, according to Nathan Serota, a solar industry analyst with Bloomberg New Energy Finance. But he concurs that there should still be a record year. Its going to be big, Serota said. The floor on 2016 will be over 9 gigawatts including all types of solar installations, he said.
Serota says the tax credit extension means there could actually be only a slight difference between 2016 and 2017, if enough projects get pushed off til next year.2016 is going to be a huge year, and then were going to continue to see big years over the next 5, he said. Granted, solar could still face some headwinds, particularly from the competition offered by extremely low natural gas prices.
In the grand scheme, the tax credits for solar, as well as an extension of the production tax credit for wind, couldserve as a kind of bridgeinto an era in which the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan is operating  or at least, so the current administration hopes. Granted, that depends on whether that plan survives its current legal challenges.
Arecent reportfrom the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that due to the tax credit extensions, the U.S. will add 53 additional gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by the year 2020.

White House Announces Additional Commitments to the American Business Act on Climate Pledge
Today, the White House will announce additional commitments from 73 companies from across the American economy who are joining the American Business Act on Climate Pledge. With this announcement, a total of 154 companies will have signed the American Business Act on Climate Pledge to demonstrate their support for action on climate change and the conclusion of a climate change agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-carbon, sustainable future. These 154 companies have operations in all 50 states, employ nearly 11 million people, represent more than $4.2 trillion in annual revenue, and have a combined market capitalization of over $7 trillion.
By signing the American Business Act on Climate pledge, these companies are:
These pledges include ambitious, company-specific goals such as:
The impacts of climate change are already being felt worldwide. Nineteen of the 20 hottest years on record occurred in the past two decades. Countries and communities around the world are already being affected by deeper, more persistent droughts, pounded by more severe weather, inundated by bigger storm surges, and imperiled by more frequent and dangerous wildfires. Rising temperatures can lead to more smog, longer allergy seasons, and an increased incidence of extreme-weather-related injuries, all of which imperil public health, particularly for vulnerable populations like children, the elderly, the sick, the poor, and some communities of color. No corner of the planet and no sector of the global economy will remain unaffected by climate change in the years ahead.
Climate change is a global challenge that demands a global response, and President Obama is committed to leading the fight. The Presidents Climate Action Plan, when fully implemented, will cut nearly 6 billion tons of carbon pollution through 2030, an amount equivalent to taking all the cars in the United States off the road for more than 4 years. The Clean Power Plan, the most significant domestic step any President has ever taken to combat climate change, will reduce emissions from the energy sector by 32% by 2030. And while the United States is leading on the international stage and the federal government is doing its part to combat climate change, hundreds of private companies, local governments, and foundations have stepped up to increase energy efficiency, boost low-carbon investing, and make solar energy more accessible to low-income Americans.
The measures taken by the public and private sectors enabled President Obama to set an ambitious but achievable goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions economy-wide by 26-28% by 2025 last November. And in the eleven months since, weve seen unprecedented global momentum in the fight against climate change.
To date, more than 180 countries representing nearly 95% of global carbon emissions have reported post-2020 climate policies to the United Nations. This includes the major economies like the U.S., China, the European Union and India and it includes a large number of smaller economies, developing nations, island states and tropical countries  some of whom are the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.
As the world looks toward Paris, President Obama is committed to building on this momentum, with American leadership at all levels  the federal government, state and local governments and the private sector.
We applaud the growing number of countries that have already set ambitious targets for climate action. In this context, we support the conclusion of a climate change agreement in Paris that takes a strong step forward toward a low-carbon, sustainable future.
We recognize that delaying action on climate change will be costly in economic and human terms, while accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy will produce multiple benefits with regard to sustainable economic growth, public health, resilience to natural disasters, and the health of the global environment.

Heres the Deal: The Text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership  The Trans-Pacific Partnership
When we have a level playing field, Americans out-compete anyone in the world. Thats a fundamental truth about our country.
But right now, the rules of global trade put our workers, our businesses, and our values at a disadvantage.
If youre an autoworker in Michigan, the cars you build face taxes as high as 70 percent in Vietnam. If youre a worker in Oregon, youre forced to compete against workers in other countries that set lower standards and pay lower wages just to cut their costs. If youre a small business owner in Ohio, you might face customs rules that are confusing, costly, and an unnecessary barrier to selling abroad.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership will change that.
Its the highest standard trade agreement in history. It eliminates 18,000 taxes that various countries put on American goods. That will boost Made-in-America exports abroad while supporting higher-paying jobs right here at home. And thats going to help our economy grow.
I know that past trade agreements havent always lived up to the hype. Thats what makes this trade agreement so different, and so important.
The TPP includes the strongest labor standards in history, from requiring a minimum wage and worker safety regulations to prohibiting child labor and forced labor. It also includes the strongest environmental commitments in history, requiring countries in one of the most biologically diverse areas on Earth to crack down on illegal wildlife trafficking, illegal logging, and illegal fishing. These standards are at the core of the agreement and are fully enforceablewhich means we can bring trade sanctions against countries that dont step up their game.
And for the first time ever, well have a multilateral trade agreement that reflects the reality of the digital economy by promoting a free and open Internet and by preventing unfair laws that restrict the free flow of data and information.
In other words, the TPP means that America will write the rules of the road in the 21st century. When it comes to Asia, one of the worlds fastest-growing regions, the rulebook is up for grabs. And if we dont pass this agreementif America doesnt write those rulesthen countries like China will. And that would only threaten American jobs and workers and undermine American leadership around the world.
Thats why I am posting the text of this agreement here for you to read and explore. Theres a lot in here, so weve put together summaries of each chapter to help you navigate whats in the agreement and what these new standards will mean for you.
I know that if you take a look at whats actually in the TPP, you will see that this is, in fact, a new type of trade deal that puts American workers first.

11 Million Sign Up For Obamacare With Weeks To Go Before Deadline
WASHINGTON -- Obamacare growth continues to outpace last year's sign-ups, with almost 11.3 million people enrolling into private health insurance plans via the exchange marketplaces through the last week of December, the Department of Health and Human Services disclosed Thursday. The open enrollment period on the exchanges lasts until Jan. 31, and the tally of enrollees has already exceeded the department's projection of 10 million for the full year. Although this total likely will come down in the coming months as some consumers drop their coverage or fail to pay their premiums, these findings suggest these marketplaces are performing above expectations so far. During the comparable period a year ago, 9.5 million had enrolled nationwide. Expanding the exchanges is key not only to covering more of the uninsured, but to stabilizing the new marketplaces for the future. More than sheer numbers, the makeup of the exchange customer base is crucial, especially after health insurance companies reported losses during the marketplaces' first two years because enrollees proved sicker and costlier than expected. That resulted in higher premium increases for this year compared to 2015, and raised concerns about the affordability of coverage on the exchanges. President Barack Obama's administration sees promising indicators in the first national report on sign-ups under the Affordable Care Act in 2016. So far, 3 million of the enrollees are new to the exchanges.
In addition to a faster rise in enrollments since Nov. 1, 2015, than during the same period a year earlier, the Department of Health and Human Services touted the share of younger customers, who are vital to the financial success of the exchanges because they typically have fewer medical needs than older enrollees and because low-risk insurance customers are needed to cover the expenses for higher-risk ones. Thirty-five percent of enrollees so far are younger than 35, and 26 percent are between ages 18 and 34, the report says. In the states where residents use HealthCare.gov, more than 40 percent of those 35 years old or younger are new to the exchanges. These percentages are similar to thoseat the end of the 2015 sign-up period last March, but higher than those at the same stage of the enrollment push at the end of 2014, said Richard Frank, assistant secretary for planning and evaluation at the Department of Health and Human Services, during a conference call with reporters.At the end of 2014, 29 percent of HealthCare.gov enrollees were under 35, and 23 percent were between 18 and 34, the department reported at the time. "What we are seeing is an uptick in new young consumers.We expect that to sort of accelerate as we hit the deadline," Frank said, which is what happened during the 2014 and 2015 enrollment periods. Were encouraged that marketplace consumers are increasingly young, engaged and shopping for the best plan. We have more work to do before the next deadlines and our focus continues to be the consumer experience and educating consumers about available financial assistance and their choices," Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a press release.
Of the 11.3 million people signed up through late December, 8.5 million used the federal HealthCare.gov system in place for residents of 38 states, while 2.7 million enrolled via the marketplaces operated by 12 states and the District of Columbia. Eighty-three percent of enrollees qualified for tax credit subsidies to reduce their monthly premiums, and the average value of the subsidies is $294. Mid-level "silver" insurance policies again proved the most popular, with 68 percent of enrollees choosing these options over bronze, gold, platinum or the very-high-deductible "catastrophic" plans available mainly to people younger than 30. During the past two enrollment periods, exchange officials stressed that enrollees should return to the marketplaces to shop for better deals rather than allow themselves to be automatically renewed into their policies. Volatile premiums -- including huge increases for some consumers -- are the main reason officials urged comparing plans and prices, and consumers have responded. Just over half of the 8.2 million 2015 enrollees seeking coverage for this year actively shopped before choosing a plan, and 6 in 10 of those people selected a new policy. That's higher than during the previous sign-up campaign, and higher than the rate in other segments of the insurance market, said Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, during the conference call. In addition, the closure of a dozen health insurers and enrollment freezes at others forced hundreds of thousands of consumers to seek new coverage this year.
One factor that could encourage more people to sign up this year -- and larger numbers of young adults, in particular -- is that the tax penalty for not having health insurance is set to increase substantially, to a minimum of $695 per adult and $347.50 per child and to a maximum that could be thousands of dollars, depending on family size and household income.
Yet Another Legal Organization Throws Its Weight Behind Merrick Garland
In a report sent to the Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Tuesday, the ABAs Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary deemed Garland well qualified to serve on the court. To merit the rating, the committee must find that the nominee hasoutstanding legal ability and exceptional breadth of experience, and meet the very highest standards of integrity, professional competence and judicial temperament.
The American Bar Association has given its highest rating to Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.
As a nonpartisan organization, the ABA maintained that the rating was not based on political affiliation or ideology.
The ABA Standing Committee interviewed hundreds of legal professionals who have worked with Garland, and the overwhelming majority had nothing but praise for him.
One commenter remarked, Garland is the best that there is. He is the finest judge I have ever met. There is no one who is his peer.
Another suggested, He may be the perfect human being.
Of the eight justices who currently serve on the Supreme Court, only Justice Clarence Thomas received an ABArating lower than well qualified upon being nominated.

It's a wrap: OFA's first annual Campus Organizing Summit
Earlier this month, 35 campus-based activists from all across the country came together at OFA headquarters in Chicago for the first-ever Campus Organizing Summit.The Campus Organizing Summit is part of a series of issue-focused trainings, which throughout this year have provided organizers with opportunities to expand their networks, problem solve challenges, and develop new skillswhile strengthening the pipeline of organizing talent in the progressive world.At the Campus Organizing Summit, participants kicked off the day by sharing their experiences and challenges back home, and exchanged ideas to help improve the impact of their work. In true OFA style, this training summit went beyond conversationstudents had to put their newly developed skills into action. In an innovative three-hour Lobby Games simulation, students had to apply what they had learned in order to effectively build issue advocacy campaigns. Their ultimate goal: to persuade key decision makers in their communities.Students worked with OFA training coaches to analyze a fictional failed campus issue campaign. Through these exercises, students learned the different pieces that make up a campaignand more importantly, they became familiar with the idea that organizing never happens in a vacuum. I had never really had one term to define all of the things surrounding organizing, said Anna from the University of Arizona, as she shared her experience learning about issue ecosystems.After learning to develop a campus issue campaign to persuade key decision makers, students put that plan into practice in order to implement their strategies, build coalitions, and lobby a fictional university's president and Board of Trustees.Destiny from the University of California at Berkeley said she learned that lobbying is a powerful tool for social change, and loved the opportunity to be able to practice it. Lauryn from Northwestern University shared that she "really enjoyed being around other people my age who are passionate about organizing as well."Here's what some of the other participants had to say:Although it's not always easy, it's important for organizers to use each other as valuable resources and to set aside the time to keep learning. These campus organizers came from all over the country to learn from one another, but you can join them in taking action, too.Get in touch with organizers from across the country by joining Connect, OFA's community organizing tool.

Earth posts hottest August on record and 16th straight month of unsurpassed heat
Record-breaking heat has never persistedon the planet for so long.
Not only did Earth witness its hottestAugust on record, according to NOAA, but it also extended its streak of record-warm months to 16. Such a lengthyperiod ofrecord-setting warmth is unprecedented in 137 years oftemperature observation, NOAA said.
Augusts average temperature was 1.66 degrees above the 20th century average, 0.09 degrees above the previous warmest August  set just one year ago.
Unusually warm conditions covered most of the globe. Five of the six continents had at least a top ten warm August, with Africa and Asia observing a record high average temperature for August since continental records began in 1910, NOAA reported.
The summer period encompassing June through August wasalso the warmest on record, 0.07 degrees warmer than the summer of 2015, the previous record holder.
It is plausible that this summer was the warmest inthousands of years, perhaps even longer, climate scientistMichael Mann of Penn State University told USA Today.
Asevery month this year has established a newrecord for warmth, it follows that 2016 ranks as the warmest on record year-to-date, a substantial0.29 degrees warmer than 2015 the previous record holder for the January-August period.
All six continents had at least a top three warm JanuaryAugust period, with North America, Asia, and Oceania experiencing a record high average temperature for JanuaryAugust since continental records began in 1910, NOAA said.
The early months of 2016 recorded some of the biggest temperature departures from normal or anomalies ever observed, in large part due to a strong El Nio duringwhich heat from the tropical Pacific Ocean was released to the atmosphere.
But even as El Nio has waned, temperature anomalies have remained strongly positive. Augusts departure from normalof 0.92 degrees tied for eighth highest in 1,640 months. Fourteen of the 15 highest monthly temperature departures in the record have occurred since February 2015, with January 2007 among the 15 highest temperature departures, NOAA said.
Given the warm start to the year, NASAs climate scientist Gavin Schmidt saidtheres a 99 percent chance the year will close as the warmest on record.
Jobs report crushes expectations, unemployment rate plunges to 7-year low
Data out Friday morning showed that the US economy added 271,000 jobs in October. It was the strongest pace of employment growth this year and nearly 100,000 jobs above the consensus forecast for 182,000.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5%, its lowest level since 2008. Economists consider a 5% rate to indicate full employment. The labor-force participation rate stayed at a 38-year low, with just 62.4% of American civilians over the age of 16 working or looking for work.
Wages grew at their fastest pace since mid-2009, as average hourly earnings rose 0.4% month-on-month, better than forecast. Compared to last October, earnings rose 2.5%.
The report had been expected to show a modest rise in the pace of jobs growth, following the unexpected slump we saw over the past two months. In Friday's report, September nonfarm payrolls were revised even lower to 137,000 from 142,000.
Earlier this week, Fed chair Janet Yellen reiterated that a rate hike next month was "a live possibility" if economic data pointed to a stronger labor market and rising inflation.
This jobs report was then closely watched as an indicator of how close the labor market was to achieving the Fed's goals.
"In one line: Normal service resumed, plus wage gains = December hike," Pantheon Macroeconomics' Ian Shepherdson wrote in a client note. "After two inexplicably weak months  Aug/Sep still hard to explain  this is consistent with all the advance indicators."
The persistently low levels of initial jobless claims and gains in service-sector employment were among the indicators some economists found contradictory to the weak jobs reports.
Manufacturing employment was unchanged, beating expectations for a decline by 4,000 amid a slowdown in the sector.
Following the release, stock futures tumbled, and Dow futures lost as many as 70 points. The two-year yield, which is very sensitive to interest-rate expectations, spiked 7 basis points to as high as 0.92%.
Obama administration announces historic new regulations for methane emissions from oil and gas
This story has been updated.
The Obama administration on Thursday announceda set of much-anticipated  and first ever  steps to regulate oil and gas industry emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas second only to carbon dioxide in its role in the climate debate.
The Environmental Protection Agency unveileda new rule that will target emissions from new or modified oil and gas wells  and prevent 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by the year 2025, the agency said.
And while this would not apply to the vast numbers of existing rigs, well pads and auxiliary equipment that have driven a historic boom in domestic oil and gas production, the agency also signaled that it plans to regulate these as well. It issued a new request for more information from industry to help study how to contain emissions from these sources.
It all adds up to a suite of new or plannedregulations, by the outgoing administration, to curb fugitive emissions of a gas that is drawing ever-more attention, despite debate over precisely how much the United States is emitting and how severely that contributes to climate change.
The new policies will help combat climate change and reduce air pollution that immediately harms public health, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said on a mediacall Thursday.
Every leak that is fixed means more gas is available to be used or sold and less pollution is affecting the health of our communities, as well as the stability of our climate, McCarthy continued.
The regulations focus on new industrial equipment is significant, given the expansion expected to happen in coming years, particularly in the natural gas sector. But even more momentous would be for EPA to regulate existing equipment, which could have a far larger impact  on both emissions and on the industry itself.
The request for information in this area is really launching our work to address methane emissions from existing sources, McCarthy said, although it appeared that due to agency timelines, the administration would not be able to complete these rules before the end of the Obama administration.
Environmental advocacy groups seemed largely pleased with Thursdays announced rule for new and modified emissions sources, even as they pushed for more aggressive steps down the line.
This is the first time that EPA has ever regulated methane from any industry.And how appropriate, because this [industry] is the largest emitter of methane, said Conrad Schneider, advocacy director for Clean Air Task Force, an environmental group. Thats a really important step forward with respect to controlling greenhouse gases, and toward meeting our international commitments.
Its a significant step, and makes a significant contribution to addressing this important short term climate forcer, addedMark Brownstein, a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund. But Brownstein also noted that the United States is the worlds largest oil and gas producer, and along with that comes a lot of equipment in the field. And, therefore, it is only when you have regulations that deal with existing sources that you fully deal with the impact of the industry on the environment.
The announcementcomes shortly after the EPA charged that methane emissions  which can enhance global warming over a period of several decades  are on the upswing of late,during the same time period when voluminous U.S. shale oil and gas drilling has dramatically driven downprices for domestic natural gas and global oil alike.
The agency recently revised upward its estimates of total U.S.methane emissions  which emerge from multiple sources, not just oil and gas  from 636.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent to 721.5 million metric tons for the year 2013.The revision meant that oil and gas drilling, rather than agriculture and livestock, became the largest single source of U.S. methane emissions  further upping the stakes for regulatory action.
The industry has opposed both forms of methane emissions regulation  for new and existing sources  arguing that self-policing has been quite effectivethus far.
It doesnt make sense that the administration would add unreasonable and burdensome regulations when the industry is already leading the way on methane reductions, said Kyle Isakower, APIs vice president of regulatory and economic policy, in a call with reporters Thursday. The last thing we need is more duplicative and costly regulation that could stifle innovation and potentially lead to higher energy costs.
The groups leaders also questioned EPAs estimates of what the new regulations would cost the industry, and said thatby imposing a one-size-fits-all approach to regulating methane emissions, the EPA would saddle companies with new monitoring and record-keeping responsibilities, when companies already have good reason to find inventive ways of avoiding leaks.
Methane is the product that we sell. We are incentivized already to prevent methane emissions, said Howard Feldman, APIs senior director of regulatory and scientific affairs.
The timing for new regulation is also pretty inconvenient from an industry perspective. The industry is being asked to do more with less as oil and gas prices are low, rig counts have dwindled, and thousands have lost their jobs, noted Sandra Snyder, an attorney with Bracewell LLP, which has a number of oil and gas industryclients, in a statement.
The originally proposed regulations for new sources of emissionsemerged last summerand were aimed at cutting down on leaks of gas from storage tanks and pipelines. The final rule represents a significant improvement over the proposal last year, Schneider said.For instance, the agency ended up requiring more regular inspections than it might have, and did not completely exempt low-producing wells.
Schneider and other activists dismissed complaints that the new rules would be too onerous or costly for the industry.This pollutant, methane, is also energy. [Preventing leaks] will actually save the industry money, he argued. Many of these measures will pay for themselves in a few years.
Methane is often described in the media as being more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas, but there is significant confusion over what this actually means. The truth is that half of any amount of methane that is emitted will be gone from the atmosphere in a little over eightyears, and another half of the remainder will be gone in another eightyears (and so on). So while methane does cause considerably greater warming than an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide in the short run, it can also be cleaned up from the atmosphere much more quickly than the long-lived gas.
This reality cuts both ways  it means that carbon dioxide matters much more in the long run, but also that swift moves to curb methane emissions can have keyimpacts on warming in the immediate future.
The Obama administration has signaled plans to sharply cut industrial methane emissions, seeking reductions as high as 45 percent below 2012 levels by the year 2025.
In another piece of this agenda, the Interior Department earlier this yeartook separate stepsto curb methane leaks when energy companies drill on public lands or lands owned by Native American tribes. This would cover about 10 percent of natural gas wells.
That rule, and the one announced Thursday, go part of the way toward controlling methane, but the biggest question now becomeshow the Obama administration proceeds on existing emissions sources and, with little time left in office, whether the steps it takes in this area will be carried forward by the next presidential administration.
I think what we can expect is that the Obama administration is going to be working on this issue until the very day they leave office, Brownstein says.

Forest fires have doubled in West due to climate change, study finds
Climate change from human activity nearly doubled the area that burned in forest fires in the American West over the past 30 years, a major new scientific study has found, and larger, more intense fires are all but guaranteed in the years ahead.
On public and privately owned forest lands, 23.5 million acres burned in the 11 Western states from 1984 to 2015. Climate change was responsible forroughly 10.4 million of thoseacres  an area 30 times the size of the city of Los Angeles  because of hotter and drier conditions than otherwise would have occurred, the study from scientists at Columbia University and the University of Idaho found.
The increase is coming at a large cost, not only in lives and property but also in taxpayer expense. Last year, the federal government spent $2.1 billion fighting fires.
No matter how hard we try, the fires are going to keep getting bigger, and the reason is really clear,said Park Williams, a climate scientist at Columbias LamontDoherty Earth Observatory in New York and co-author of the research. Climate is really running the show in terms of what burns.
Driven by the burning of coal, gasoline, oil and other fossil fuels thattrap heat in the Earths atmosphere, the 10 hottest years globally since modern records began in 1880 all have occurred since 1998, according to NASA. Last year was the hottest year in that 135-year record. The previous hottest was 2014. And 2016 is on track to break the record again.
Across the vast forests of the American West, the number of fires, the size of the area burnedand the length of the fire season all have been increasing in recent decades.
Theres a difference from when I started my career 20 years ago, said Scott McLean, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. Fires are burning hotter and quicker, and more severe, more intense. To us, climate change is a proven fact.
The states included in the study were California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, Colorado and Wyoming. During the 10 years from 1984 to 1993, a total of 3.4 million acres of forest burned there, the researchers found. But 20 years later,from 2004 to 2013, there were 10.4 million acres of forests that burned. The study was published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, one of the nations leading scientific journals.
For Californians, the impact of the damage is close to home.The Soberanes fire, which began July 22 and has burned more than 132,000 acres in Big Sur, has become the most expensive wildfire in U.S. history. It surpassed $236 million last week for the equipment, food and wages of fire crews and other related costs over 80 days. The blaze is now 99 percent contained, but at its peak, more than 5,000 firefighters from around the United States battled the Soberanes fire, which began with an untended campfire in Garrapata State Park, then destroyed 57 homes and killed a bulldozer operator.
State fire commanders have been bringing on more firefighters, and keeping them on duty for longer stretches, than ever before, said McLean.
Weve seen an increase in our fire season of roughly 70 days a year over the past 50 years, he said. Look at Southern California. The fire season there is year-round now.
To be sure, climate change is not the only reason for the increase in Western forest fires. A century of fire suppression, which has built up unnaturally dense and often unhealthy pine and fir forests combined with more people building homes in rural areas, is also partially to blame, the scientists concluded.
But simply put, the West is hotter and drier now than it was a generation or two ago. Since 1970, the average temperature in forested parts of the West has increased by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Soils are more arid, and trees and brush have less moisture. One spark has a higher chance of doing immense damage.
Looking at eight measurements of weather patterns and moisture levels, including the Palmer Drought Severity Index and the MacArthur Forest Fire Danger Index, the scientists in Mondays study measured fuel aridity of the trees and brush in forests. They compared acres burned and found a close link between aridity and fire. When they crunched the totals with supercomputer climate change models, they concluded that 55 percent of the increase in fuel aridity in the past 30 years can be attributed to climate change.
Centuries ago, lightning and Indians clearing land burned more acres a year than are burning now in California, said Scott Stephens, a fire scientist at UC Berkeley who did not participate in the study. But those fires were mostly low-intensity affairs, helping clear dead underbrush. Today, because fire crews have put out blazes for generations, many forests have so much dead and living vegetation that they often explode out of control, wiping out large trees and seeds, Stephens said.
The solution, he said, is more controlled burns during wet months and logging to thin forests to restore their natural condition. Both can be expensive and politically unpopular.
My back-of-the-envelope calculation says we need to do 10 times the area we are doing today annually to make a difference, he said. This is very challenging but necessary.
Williams said higher temperatures and overgrown forests will mean larger fires for decades. After areas have burned, he said, some will grow back as before, like the lodge pole pine forests of the Northern Rockies, while others, like in parts of California, may shift from conifers to more chaparral, manzanita and oak. Most ominous, in the past 30 years only about 10 percent of forested areas in the West have burned.
It means getting out of fires way, he said. Id definitely be worried about living in a forested area with only one road in and one road out.

President Obama's boldest action on guns yet, explained
After high-profile mass shootings, President Barack Obama has urged the American people to call on Congress to pass measures that would restrict access to guns and, hopefully, reduce gun violence. But after multiple pleas, Congress hasn't acted, even after the grisly mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012.
So Obama is now acting on his own  with executive actions.
"Every single year, more than 30,000 Americans have their lives cut short by guns," Obama said at a press conference on Tuesday. "We are the only advanced country on Earth that sees this kind of mass violence erupt with this kind of frequency."
Obama metwith Attorney General Loretta Lynch on Monday to consider what he can do without congressional legislation to reduce gun violence in America, which kills many more people in the US than other developed nations. In a press conference after the meeting, White House officials announced a plan they had been working on for months behind the scenes to address gun violence.
The changes attempt to tighten  but don't close  what's widely (but misleadingly) known as the "gun show loophole," as well as increase the efficiency of the federal background check system to avoid cases from falling through. The executive actions will also take smaller steps, ranging from improving the tracking of lost or stolen guns to encouraging technological improvements that will, in theory, make firearms safer.
This would not be the first time Obama has taken executive action on guns. In 2013, after Congress failed to pass gun control legislation following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Obama signed 23 executive actions and then a few follow-up actions that generally tightened the background check system.
But Obama's latest actions appear to be the boldest, touching on one of the longest-running issues with federal gun control laws and a broader hot-button debate about what to do about America's extraordinary levels of gun violence.
There are risks to Obama acting without congressional approval. Critics of the administration have already suggested that they will challenge new executive actions in court. Not getting legislation in the books also means that a President Ted Cruz (or Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, and so on) could unilaterally reverse Obama's actions. Shortly before the announcement of the plan, a congressional Republican alsothreatened to block funding for the Justice Department to stop the executive actions.
The Obama administration has pushed on anyway, arguing in an email, "The president has made clear the most impactful way to address the crisis of gun violence in our country is for Congress to pass some common sense gun safety measures. But the president has also said he's fully aware of the unfortunate political realities in this Congress. That is why he has asked his team to scrub existing legal authorities to see if there's any additional action we can take administratively."
Obama is also taking his call for more actions to the American people: On Thursday, he's participating in aCNN town hall about guns.
Here's what the Obama administration plans to do:
In addition to these measures, the administration will continue pushing Congress to pass tighter gun control laws, and to direct more funds to enforcing existing gun laws and to mental health treatment.
Obama's executive actions are a small but significant tweak to existing laws. In the US, there are several restrictions in federal law to buying a gun. Generally, the idea is that Americans who are underage, have serious criminal backgrounds, or are mentally ill should not be able to purchase a firearm.
Whether someone falls into any of these categories is typically evaluated through a background check: Under the federal system, licensed dealers are required to run these checks before they can sell someone a gun, typically by having the FBI check a person's criminal record, mental health history, and other factors. If someone fails a background check, he or she can't legally buy a gun.
But the system is riddled with loopholes. The most well-known way to bypass background checks is the private sales loophole: If someone purchases a gun from a private seller, such as a friend or family member, no gun background check is required. This is often mischaracterized as the "gun show loophole," under the assumption that people can simply go to a gun show and buy a gun without getting a background check. But licensed dealers at gun shows still have to carry out a background check. The actual loophole is that someone can meet with a private seller at a gun show  or, increasingly, over the internet  and buy a firearm from that person without a background check. In other words, the gun show doesn't create a loophole; the private sale does.
An equally big problem is that the system of background checks is notoriously underfunded, understaffed, and underresourced. Although there are no waiting periods under federal law, a check that turns out inconclusive can be extended for three business days. But these three days are a maximum for the government  and sometimes the three days lapse without the FBI completing its check, and a buyer can at that point purchase a gun without the completed check.
The FBI admitted that something like this happened with the shooter who killed nine people at a predominantly black church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015: That shooter should have failed a background check for a handgun purchase after admitting to illegally possessing controlled substances in the past, but the FBI examiner did not obtain the shooter's record in time.
The federal background check system also largely relies on states' reports, including some data for mental health history and criminal records. Since states have their own budget issues to deal with, or may simply ideologically oppose the idea of background checks, states' noncompliance can create yet another way the system can fail to stop someone who shouldn't buy a gun from obtaining one. (State laws treat guns in a wide variety of ways; Slate has a good rundown of the differences.)
Obama's executive actions don't completely close any of these loopholes and faults in existing law, including the "gun show loophole," but they do take steps to tighten current restrictions on firearms and ensure that federal officials can actually enforce the law that's on the books.
Following the mass shooting in Sandy Hook Elementary School in which a gunman killed 20 children, six adults, and himself, Congress was pressured to pass a bill that would have tightened the private sales loophole and potentially taken other steps toward restricting access to guns. But negotiations over the bill eventually fell apart, leading Obama to act on his own.
It can be difficult to understand how the US hasn't done much to combat gun violence for years. America is unique not just in terms of gun violence but in terms of gun ownership  the country has by far the highest rates of gun ownership in the world. The research clearly shows that more guns mean more gun violence, so all those guns are leading to more deaths. And the public widely supports closing the loopholes in the law. Yet even with this research and public support, and despite thousands of mass shootings during Obama's time in office, Congress has decided not to act.
The reasons for this are complicated, but they're generally rooted in America's strong gun culture and the powerful lobby behind that culture.
The single most powerful political organization when it comes to guns is, undoubtedly, the National Rifle Association, which has an enormous stranglehold over conservative politics in America.
Anytime there's an attempt to impose new forms of gun control, the NRA rallies gun owners and other opponents of gun control to kill such proposals. These gun owners make up a minority of the population: anywhere from 34 to 43 percent of households, depending on which survey one uses. But that population is a large and active enough constituency, particularly within the Republican base, to make many legislators fear that a poor grade from the NRA will end their careers.
As a result, conservative media and politicians take the NRA's support  especially the coveted A-to-F ratings the organization gives out  very, very seriously. Sometimes politicians will go to absurd lengths to show their support for gun rights. For example, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) last year starred in a video, from IJ Review, in which he cooked bacon with  this is not a joke  a machine gun.
Although several campaigns have popped up over the years to try to counteract the NRA, none has come close to capturing the kind of influential hold that the organization has. Some of the groups  such as StopTheNRA.com, in part funded by Democratic donor Ken Lerer  didn't even last a few years.
Kristin Goss, author of The Gun Debate: What Everyone Needs to Know, said this might be changing. She argued that newer gun control groups like Everytown for Gun Safety and Americans for Responsible Solutions are much more organized, are better funded, and have more grassroots support than gun control groups have had in her 20 years covering this issue. As a result, Democrats at the state and federal level seem much more willing to discuss gun control.
But supporters of gun control face a huge obstacle: far more passionate opponents. As Republican strategist Grover Norquist said in 2000, "The question is intensity versus preference. You can always get a certain percentage to say they are in favor of some gun controls. But are they going to vote on their 'control' position?" Probably not, Norquist suggested, "but for that 4-5 percent who care about guns, they will vote on this."
What's behind that passion? Goss, who's also a political scientist at Duke University, suggested it's a sense of tangible loss  gun owners feel like the government is going to take their guns and rights. In comparison, gun control advocates are motivated by more abstract notions of reducing gun violence  although, Goss noted, the victims of mass shootings and their families have begun to put a face on these policies by engaging more actively in advocacy work, which could make the gun control movement feel more relatable.
There is an exception at the state level, where legislatures have passed laws imposing (and relaxing) restrictions on guns. In 2014, for instance, Washington state and Oregon passed laws ensuring all guns have to go through background checks, including those sold between individuals. "There's a lot more going on than Congress," Goss said. "In blue states, gun laws are getting stricter. And in red states, in some cases, the gun laws are getting looser."
Still, the NRA's influence and its army of supporters push many of America's legislators, particularly at the federal level and red states, away from gun control measures  even though some countries that passed these policies have seen a lot of success with them. From Obama's perspective, that forced him to act alone to get something done on guns.
Although Obama's executive action will help slightly restrict access to guns, it won't come anywhere close to bringing levels of gun violence down to the levels of other developed countries. Neither would the Senate bill that ultimately failed. The reason for that is simple: The problem is, fundamentally, that the US has a lot of guns, so any measure that doesn't significantly reduce the number of guns will ultimately fall short of fully addressing violence.
The research on this is very clear. Reviews of the evidence by the Harvard School of Public Health's Injury Control Research Center have concluded that more guns lead to more gun violence. Other factors, such as socioeconomic issues, obviously contribute to violence, but guns are the one issue that makes America unique relative to other developed countries in comparable socioeconomic circumstances.
Take, for instance, this chart, from a 2007 study by Harvard researchers, showing the correlation between statewide firearm homicide victimization rates and household gun ownership after controlling for robbery rates:
A more recent study from 2013, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, reached similar conclusions: After controlling for multiple variables, the study found that a 1 percent increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate at the state level.
This holds up around the world. As Vox's Zack Beauchamp explained, a breakthrough analysis in 1999 by UC Berkeley's Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins found that the US does not, contrary to the old conventional wisdom, have more crime in general than other Western industrial nations. Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence  and that's driven in large part by the prevalence of guns.
"A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar," Zimring and Hawkins wrote. "A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London."
How can the country address this? The research shows tightening existing gun control measures in the US would help. But as Harvard's David Hemenway told Vox's Dylan Matthews, it would likely take decades for the mild gun control measures proposed in the US to have a significant impact. "It's all speculation," Hemenway said. "I suspect it would take a while (decades) for the US to get down to gun violence levels of other developed countries because a) we have so many guns which are durable, and b) we have a gun culture  we tend to use guns more often in more situations than citizens of other developed countries."
To have a more immediate impact, then, the US would have to find a way to quickly remove the number of guns in circulation. Other countries have actually done that: In Australia, after a 1996 mass shooting, lawmakers passed new restrictions on guns and imposed a mandatory buyback program that essentially confiscated people's guns, seizing at least 650,000 firearms.
According to one review of the evidence by Harvard researchers, Australia's firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent. Although it's hard to gauge how much of this was driven by the buyback program, researchers argue it likely played some role: "First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates."
Still, similar measures would be very difficult to pass in America, due to the strength of gun culture and the gun lobby in the US  pushing Obama to act without Congress with a much smaller policy tweak.

Heres the Deal: The Text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership  The Trans-Pacific Partnership
When we have a level playing field, Americans out-compete anyone in the world. Thats a fundamental truth about our country.
But right now, the rules of global trade put our workers, our businesses, and our values at a disadvantage.
If youre an autoworker in Michigan, the cars you build face taxes as high as 70 percent in Vietnam. If youre a worker in Oregon, youre forced to compete against workers in other countries that set lower standards and pay lower wages just to cut their costs. If youre a small business owner in Ohio, you might face customs rules that are confusing, costly, and an unnecessary barrier to selling abroad.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership will change that.
Its the highest standard trade agreement in history. It eliminates 18,000 taxes that various countries put on American goods. That will boost Made-in-America exports abroad while supporting higher-paying jobs right here at home. And thats going to help our economy grow.
I know that past trade agreements havent always lived up to the hype. Thats what makes this trade agreement so different, and so important.
The TPP includes the strongest labor standards in history, from requiring a minimum wage and worker safety regulations to prohibiting child labor and forced labor. It also includes the strongest environmental commitments in history, requiring countries in one of the most biologically diverse areas on Earth to crack down on illegal wildlife trafficking, illegal logging, and illegal fishing. These standards are at the core of the agreement and are fully enforceablewhich means we can bring trade sanctions against countries that dont step up their game.
And for the first time ever, well have a multilateral trade agreement that reflects the reality of the digital economy by promoting a free and open Internet and by preventing unfair laws that restrict the free flow of data and information.
In other words, the TPP means that America will write the rules of the road in the 21st century. When it comes to Asia, one of the worlds fastest-growing regions, the rulebook is up for grabs. And if we dont pass this agreementif America doesnt write those rulesthen countries like China will. And that would only threaten American jobs and workers and undermine American leadership around the world.
Thats why I am posting the text of this agreement here for you to read and explore. Theres a lot in here, so weve put together summaries of each chapter to help you navigate whats in the agreement and what these new standards will mean for you.
I know that if you take a look at whats actually in the TPP, you will see that this is, in fact, a new type of trade deal that puts American workers first.

Obama: Why Senate must vote on Supreme Court nomination
Nominating a Supreme Court Justice is one of the most consequential roles our Constitution entrusts to any President. Its a moment that demands us to rise above short-term politics in order to maintain the integrity of our democratic institutions. Our Supreme Court justices are the final arbiters of American law. They safeguard our rights and freedoms, ensuring that our system is one of laws, not of men, and that we continue to be governed by our Constitution and the laws passed by Congress.
This is a duty I take very seriously. Thats why, last week, I nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland to the court. Judge Garland is not simply one of our most brilliant legal minds, but a man renowned on both sides of the aisle for his character, his decency, his ability to build consensus, and his fidelity to the law. So Id like to tell you a little bit more about Judge Garland, and why its so important that his nomination is treated with the seriousness it deserves.
Judge Garland grew up in my hometown of Chicago. His mom served as a community volunteer. His dad ran a small business out of their basement. And they impressed upon him the importance of working hard, dealing fairly, and serving his community.
As a young lawyer, Judge Garland could have comfortably salted away his years as a partner at a lucrative private firm. Instead, he chose public service, taking a job as a low-level prosecutor in the George H.W. Bush administration. Eventually, he oversaw the federal response to the Oklahoma City bombing, taking great care to bring justice for an unspeakable crime. He worked side-by-side with law enforcement. He reached out to victims and their families. Everywhere he went, he carried with him in his briefcase the program from the memorial service with each of the victims names inside.
For the last 19 years, Judge Garland has served on whats often known as the second highest court in the land  the D.C. Circuit Court  including the last three as chief judge. Hes admired for his courtesy, his devotion to family, and that civic-minded spirit he learned from his parents. Hes even served as a tutor for young students at a local D.C. elementary school for the past 18 years.
On the bench, Judge Garland has shown an understanding that justice isnt simply abstract legal theory; it affects peoples daily lives. So he knows that our courts must preserve liberty, and that the powerful and the powerless deserve equal justice under the law. And in his work, he is widely regarded for his excellence, modesty, even-handedness, and ability to bring people together. Thats why I believe Judge Garland is exactly the kind of judge we need on the Supreme Court.
For a long time, some Republicans have said as much themselves. During my time as president, one name has come up more than any other in discussions about potential justices, from Democrats and Republicans alike  Merrick Garland. And back in the 1990s, when he was first nominated to serve on the federal bench, Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Republican head of the Judiciary Committee said, In all honesty, I would like to see one person come to this floor and say one reason why Merrick Garland does not deserve this position.
I understand that were in the midst of an especially volatile political season. But at a time when our politics are so polarized, we should treat a process of this magnitude  the appointment of a Supreme Court justice  with the seriousness it deserves.
Ive done my constitutional duty. Now its up to each senator to fulfill his or hers. All Im asking is simply for the Senate to act fairly. To act with the level-headedness and foresight required in our exercise in self-government. And to give Judge Garland  by all accounts an outstanding individual; someone with more experience on the federal bench than any Supreme Court nominee in history  the respect he has earned. Give him a hearing. Give him a vote.
To deny it would indicate a process for nominating and confirming judges that is beyond repair. It would make it increasingly impossible for any president, Republican or Democrat, to carry out their constitutional function. To go down that path would jeopardize our system of justice, hurt our democracy, and betray the vision of our founding.
We cant go down that road. So Im asking people here in California to make your voices heard. Let your senators know how important this is. Tell them that our courts should be above politics, not an extension of politics. Because this is bigger than a few news cycles, or even a single election. Its about the integrity of our system of justice. Its a question of whether or not well live up to the responsibilities our founders entrusted to us. Thats been the duty of Americans for more than two centuries. And now its up to us to carry forward that story for our time.

Middle-class Americans and the poor enjoyed their best year of economic improvement in decades in 2015, the Census Bureau reported Tuesday, a spike that brokea years-long streak of disappointment for American workers but did not fully repair the damage inflicted by the Great Recession.
Real median household income was $56,500 in 2015, the bureau reported, up from $53,700 in 2014. That5.2 percent increase was the largest, in percentage terms, recorded by the bureau since it began tracking median income statistics in the 1960s.
In addition, the poverty rate fell by 1.2percentage points, the steepest decline since 1968. There were 43.1 million Americans in poverty on the year, 3.5million fewer than in 2014.The share of Americans who lack health insurance continued a years-long decline, falling 1.3 percentage points, to 9.1 percent.
A combination of forces fueledthe gains, including an improving job market, low inflation and rising wages, particularly for low-earning workers who may have benefited from state and local initiatives to boost minimum wages.
[Things are getting a lot better for the working poor]
And whileincomes increased for men and for women - with the income gap between the two genders narrowing slightly - and across racial and ethnic groups, they did not reach all workers evenly. Median incomes did not budge significantly in rural areas, while in cities, they grew by 7.3 percent. The South saw significantly weaker income growth than the West.
On health care, states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act continued to see a decline in their uninsured rate, widening a coverage gap withthose states that did not expand the program.
The numbersfrom the government's annual report on income, poverty and health insurance, complicate the economic narrative underpinning the 2016 presidential election. Theywere hailed by the Obama administration and by Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, but greeted with silence by Republican nominee Donald Trump, who frequently cites median income stagnation as a sign of American decline.
"This exceeds the strong expectation that I already had, Jason Furman, chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview, in which he called the income report the strongest ever from the Census Bureau.The news here is the growth rates. Ive read the last 21 reports, including this one. I have never seen one like this, in terms of, everything you look at is what youd want to see or better.
Some Republicans discounted the improved outlook, saying the overall numbers remain weaker than they should be.
Todays report is another disappointing confirmation that too many Americans are still struggling to provide for their families and reach their full potential. The federal government invests billions of dollars each year in programs to help low-income Americans  but more than 43 million people continue to live in poverty. It shouldnt be this way in America," House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Tex.) said in a statement.
The numbers appear to run counter to Trump's contention thatAmerica is in decline and working people's lives are getting worse. Trump frequently cites median income stagnation, relying on previous Census data, on the campaign trail. His campaign had not released a statement on the new Census report as of midday Tuesday.
One of Trump's economic advisers, Stephen Moore, cautioned in an interview that the 2015 increase could be a "blip" that fades in 2016, because the economy is growing slowly, and that they still do not make up for more than a decade of income stagnation.
Its a very good thing that we finally have some income growth for middle-class families," Moore said. "But the most depressing thing about where we stand in America  and I think this is why the Trump phenomenon has taken hold  is that the average American is still poorer today than it was 15 years ago.
Clinton has argued that the economy is improving under President Obama but that working families still need more help to get ahead. Her campaign said Tuesday that the Census numbers reinforce that view.
These are really positive numbers by and large. They show real progress, said Jacob Leibenluft, a senior policy adviser to the Clinton campaign. He added:This is definitely at odds with the picture that Trump provides.
Liberal economists said it was encouraging that the gains started with the workers who earn the least. Incomegrew mostfor the lowest-earning workers and least for the highest-earning ones, though all income groups saw improvement.
The highest income growth was in the bottom fifth" of workers, "which is very welcome news, said Lawrence Mishel, president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute think tank. Furman, of the White House, credited wage-boosting policy initiatives for some of that increase:The fact that millions of workers have gotten a raise, as states have raised minimum wages, has definitely had an effect there," he said.
All told, the gains brought median incomes nearly back to their levelsbefore the recession, after adjusting for inflation, though they remain below 1999 levels.Bureau officials said the 5.2 percent growth ratewas not statistically distinguishable from five other previous increases in the data, most recently the 3.7 percent jump from 1997 to 1998.
Several measures had suggested that 2015 was strong for wage growth.Other indicators had pointed to an improvement for the Americans who are the worst off. The unemployment rate had declined to 4.9 percent as of last month.
Since 2014, increases in wages have accelerated for the one in five workers earning the least, according to new research by Bank of America. In this group, wages are now increasing at roughly 4 percent year over year.
Last week, the Agriculture Department released its annual data on hunger in the United States, showing that food insecurity declined substantially last year for the first time since the recession.
The share of food-insecure households was 12.7 percent last year, down from 14 percent in 2014. Before 2014, food insecurity had remained stubbornly persistent, improving only modestly from an apex of 14.9 percent in 2011. The Agriculture Department defines food security as having access to enough food for an active, healthy life.
Indicators of economic confidence have risen this year, and with them, Obama's approval rating.
Were finally in the moment when the middle class and some lower-income families are feeling the benefits of economic growth, said Neera Tanden, president of the liberal Center for American Progress think tank and a Clinton adviser. That its taken this long shows something about the structure of the economy.

Barack Obama: Why we must rethink solitary confinement
In 2010, a 16-year-old named Kalief Browder from the Bronx was accused of stealing a backpack. He was sent to Rikers Island to await trial, where he reportedly endured unspeakable violence at the hands of inmates and guards  and spent nearly two years in solitary confinement.
In 2013, Kalief was released, having never stood trial. He completed a successful semester at Bronx Community College. But life was a constant struggle to recover from the trauma of being locked up alone for 23 hours a day. One Saturday, he committed suicide at home. He was just 22 years old.
Solitary confinement gained popularity in the United States in the early 1800s, and the rationale for its use has varied over time. Today, its increasingly overused on people such as Kalief, with heartbreaking results  which is why my administration is taking steps to address this problem.
There are as many as 100,000 people held in solitary confinement in U.S. prisons  including juveniles and people with mental illnesses. As many as 25,000 inmates are serving months, even years of their sentences alone in a tiny cell, with almost no human contact.
Research suggests that solitary confinement has the potential to lead to devastating, lasting psychological consequences. It has been linked to depression, alienation, withdrawal, a reduced ability to interact with others and the potential for violent behavior. Some studies indicate that it can worsen existing mental illnesses and even trigger new ones. Prisoners in solitary are more likely to commit suicide, especially juveniles and people with mental illnesses.
The United States is a nation of second chances, but the experience of solitary confinement too often undercuts that second chance. Those who do make it out often have trouble holding down jobs, reuniting with family and becoming productive members of society. Imagine having served your time and then being unable to hand change over to a customer or look your wife in the eye or hug your children.
As president, my most important job is to keep the American people safe. And since I took office, overall crime rates have decreased by more than 15percent. In our criminal justice system, the punishment should fit the crime  and those who have served their time should leave prison ready to become productive members of society. How can we subject prisoners to unnecessary solitary confinement, knowing its effects, and then expect them to return to our communities as whole people? It doesnt make us safer. Its an affront to our common humanity.
Thats why last summer, I directed Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch and the Justice Department to review the overuse of solitary confinement across U.S. prisons. They found that there are circumstances when solitary is a necessary tool, such as when certain prisoners must be isolated for their own protection or in order to protect staff and other inmates. In those cases, the practice should be limited, applied with constraints and used only as a measure of last resort. They have identified common-sense principles that should guide the use of solitary confinement in our criminal justice system.
The Justice Department has completed its review, and I am adopting its recommendations to reform the federal prison system. These include banning solitary confinement for juveniles and as a response to low-level infractions, expanding treatment for the mentally ill and increasing the amount of time inmates in solitary can spend outside of their cells. These steps will affect some 10,000 federal prisoners held in solitary confinement  and hopefully serve as a model for state and local corrections systems. And I will direct all relevant federal agencies to review these principles and report back to me with a plan to address their use of solitary confinement.
[More coverage: Obama bans solitary confinement for juveniles in federal prisons]
States that have led the way are already seeing positive results. Colorado cut the number of people in solitary confinement, and assaults against staff are the lowest theyve been since 2006. New Mexico implemented reforms and has seen a drop in solitary confinement, with more prisoners engaging in promising rehabilitation programs. And since 2012, federal prisons have cut the use of solitary confinement by 25 percent and significantly reduced assaults on staff.
Reforming solitary confinement is just one part of a broader bipartisan push for criminal justice reform. Every year, we spend $80 billion to keep 2.2million people incarcerated. Many criminals belong behind bars. But too many others, especially nonviolent drug offenders, are serving unnecessarily long sentences. Thats why members of Congress in both parties are pushing for change, from reforming sentencing laws to expanding reentry programs to give those who have paid their debt to society the tools they need to become productive members of their communities. And I hope they will send me legislation as soon as possible that makes our criminal justice system smarter, fairer, less expensive and more effective.
In America, we believe in redemption. We believe, in the words of Pope Francis, that every human person is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only benefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes. We believe that when people make mistakes, they deserve the opportunity to remake their lives. And if we can give them the hope of a better future, and a way to get back on their feet, then we will leave our children with a country that is safer, stronger and worthy of our highest ideals.

Behind The Lens: Somewhere Under the Rainbow  Vantage
When people ask me how I do what I do, I often recite the words of Bob Dylan: I was just doing what I could with what I had where Iwas. That kind of sums up my approach to my job as the Presidents photographer. Every once in a while, you also just get very lucky. Such was the case last week, when a rainbow came along just as the Presidents helicopter was arriving at the airport in Kingston, Jamaica, where he would board Air Force One for the flight to Panama. Fortunately, I was manifested aboard the second helicopterwhich always arrives before Marine Onegiving me a few minutes to prepare for photographing the rainbow. In the first photograph, I framed the rainbow above Marine One as the President disembarked the helicopter.
Meanwhile, after photographing the departure greets, I ran under the wing of the plane to try and line up where the President would be when he waved goodbye at the top of the stairs.
Both Amanda and I did what we could, with what we had, where we were. Now I had to choose the best photograph for our Photo of the Day. But photography is very subjectiveespecially when it comes to choosing which photograph is thebest. There were three final selects to choose from. I liked Amandas photograph of the President ascending the stairs, especially because the President was still lit by the sunlight. I thought my photograph of the President with Prime Minister Simpson-Miller had a more Jamaican feel to it, with the bright colors and dramatic clouds overhead. And I guessed right where the President would land when he waved, with his right hand framed right in the middle of the rainbow. But the sun was no longer illuminating the President, so it was more of a semi-silhouette. I thought the wave photograph was more graphic and, in the end, the best one. But I wasnt sure. So I sent the three selects to Press Secretary Josh Earnest for his opinion. He agreed that he thought the wave photograph was the best. I think that was the right choice, but againphotography is subjective, so Im curious to see what others think. What do you think? Leave a comment on Medium or let me know on Twitter, @PeteSouza, which photograph is your favorite. Im looking forward to hearing from you.

A Responsibility I Take Seriously
The Constitution vests in the President the power to appoint judges to the Supreme Court. Its a duty that I take seriously, and one that I will fulfill in the weeks ahead.
Its also one of the most important decisions that a President will make. Rulings handed down by the Supreme Court directly affect our economy, our security, our rights, and our daily lives.
Needless to say, this isnt something I take lightly. Its a decision to which I devote considerable time, deep reflection, careful deliberation, and serious consultation with legal experts, members of both political parties, and people across the political spectrum. And with thanks to SCOTUSblog for allowing me to guest post today, I thought Id share some spoiler-free insights into what I think about before appointing the person who will be our next Supreme Court Justice.
First and foremost, the person I appoint will be eminently qualified. He or she will have an independent mind, rigorous intellect, impeccable credentials, and a record of excellence and integrity. Im looking for a mastery of the law, with an ability to hone in on the key issues before the Court, and provide clear answers to complex legal questions.
Second, the person I appoint will be someone who recognizes the limits of the judiciarys role; who understands that a judges job is to interpret the law, not make the law. I seek judges who approach decisions without any particular ideology or agenda, but rather a commitment to impartial justice, a respect for precedent, and a determination to faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand.
But Im also mindful that there will be cases that reach the Supreme Court in which the law is not clear. There will be cases in which a judges analysis necessarily will be shaped by his or her own perspective, ethics, and judgment. Thats why the third quality I seek in a judge is a keen understanding that justice is not about abstract legal theory, nor some footnote in a dusty casebook. Its the kind of life experience earned outside the classroom and the courtroom; experience that suggests he or she views the law not only as an intellectual exercise, but also grasps the way it affects the daily reality of peoples lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times. That, I believe, is an essential element for arriving at just decisions and fair outcomes.
A sterling record. A deep respect for the judiciarys role. An understanding of the way the world really works. Thats what Im considering as I fulfill my constitutional duty to appoint a judge to our highest court. And as Senators prepare to fulfill their constitutional responsibility to consider the person I appoint, I hope theyll move quickly to debate and then confirm this nominee so that the Court can continue to serve the American people at full strength.

Scorching March temperatures set a global record  for the third straight month this year
This story has been updated.
On Friday,NASA released the latest temperature data for the globe, showing that March of 2016 was the hottest March on record since reliable measurements began in 1880. The month was 1.28 degrees Celsius, or 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit, higher than the average temperature in March from 1951 through 1980, with particularly scorching temperatures in the Arctic (as has been the case throughout this year so far).
This follows on temperatures for January and February that, NASA data show, were also the warmest for their respective months in the agencys dataset. The February departure even prompted the following Tweet from Gavin Schmidt, who directs the agencys Goddard Institute for Space Studies:
If you dip back into last year, meanwhile, you find still more monthly temperature records  but youll also note that the temperature departures in 2016 have, so far, exceeded even those in 2015, the official warmest year on record. This extreme heat around the world, which scientists believe reflect both a now-weakening El Nino event and also the background influence of climate change, has traveled alongside striking impacts. Coral reefs are bleaching and in some cases dying, Greenland has shown major melting earlier in the year than at any time on record, and Arctic sea ice has set several records so far this year for low winter extent. Stefan Rahmstorf, a researcher with the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, has already shown just how much change these data represent since the year 1880:
The analysis suggests that, if temperatures indeed persist at these high levels, then the globe might be nearing a 1.5 degree Celsius increase over pre-industrial temperatures, which is one of the thresholds that the international community has recognized as important to avoid.
And as if thats not enough, NASAs Schmidt just predicted, based on the first three months of this year alone, that 2016 as a whole will set another all time temperature record, outdistancing both 2014 and 2015:
And its not just NASA data: The Japan Meteorological Agency recentlyalso foundthat March 2016 was the hottest March in its temperature dataset, which goes back to 1891.
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which also keeps a dataset constructed in a somewhat different way from NASAs, has not yet reported on Marchs global temperatures  its assessment is expected next week.
And then, there are the satellites  the temperature datasets relied upon most by those who tend to question climate change. These, too, have been showing quite hot temperatures lately.
According tothe University of Alabama-Huntsville team, March of 2016 saw the third largest warm anomaly, or departure from average, of any month in their satellite dataset, which goes back to late 1978. The month was 0.73 degrees Celsius, or 1.31 degrees Fahrenheit, above average, the group reported, for a region of the atmosphere known as the lower troposphere (from the Earths surface up to about 6 miles into the atmosphere). That made it the warmest March on record, and the third most anomalously hot month other than February of this year and April of 1998(which fell during another strong El Nino event).
We still havent sorted out all the consequences of the burst of major heat that the planet is now seeing, and with El Nino fading, it isnt expected to continue at this high of a pitch. Still, its startling  bringing into focus, perhaps as never before, what a warming planet really looks like.

Weekly Address: President Obamas Supreme Court Nomination
Obama: Why Senate must vote on Supreme Court nomination
Nominating a Supreme Court Justice is one of the most consequential roles our Constitution entrusts to any President. Its a moment that demands us to rise above short-term politics in order to maintain the integrity of our democratic institutions. Our Supreme Court justices are the final arbiters of American law. They safeguard our rights and freedoms, ensuring that our system is one of laws, not of men, and that we continue to be governed by our Constitution and the laws passed by Congress.
This is a duty I take very seriously. Thats why, last week, I nominated Chief Judge Merrick Garland to the court. Judge Garland is not simply one of our most brilliant legal minds, but a man renowned on both sides of the aisle for his character, his decency, his ability to build consensus, and his fidelity to the law. So Id like to tell you a little bit more about Judge Garland, and why its so important that his nomination is treated with the seriousness it deserves.
Judge Garland grew up in my hometown of Chicago. His mom served as a community volunteer. His dad ran a small business out of their basement. And they impressed upon him the importance of working hard, dealing fairly, and serving his community.
As a young lawyer, Judge Garland could have comfortably salted away his years as a partner at a lucrative private firm. Instead, he chose public service, taking a job as a low-level prosecutor in the George H.W. Bush administration. Eventually, he oversaw the federal response to the Oklahoma City bombing, taking great care to bring justice for an unspeakable crime. He worked side-by-side with law enforcement. He reached out to victims and their families. Everywhere he went, he carried with him in his briefcase the program from the memorial service with each of the victims names inside.
For the last 19 years, Judge Garland has served on whats often known as the second highest court in the land  the D.C. Circuit Court  including the last three as chief judge. Hes admired for his courtesy, his devotion to family, and that civic-minded spirit he learned from his parents. Hes even served as a tutor for young students at a local D.C. elementary school for the past 18 years.
On the bench, Judge Garland has shown an understanding that justice isnt simply abstract legal theory; it affects peoples daily lives. So he knows that our courts must preserve liberty, and that the powerful and the powerless deserve equal justice under the law. And in his work, he is widely regarded for his excellence, modesty, even-handedness, and ability to bring people together. Thats why I believe Judge Garland is exactly the kind of judge we need on the Supreme Court.
For a long time, some Republicans have said as much themselves. During my time as president, one name has come up more than any other in discussions about potential justices, from Democrats and Republicans alike  Merrick Garland. And back in the 1990s, when he was first nominated to serve on the federal bench, Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Republican head of the Judiciary Committee said, In all honesty, I would like to see one person come to this floor and say one reason why Merrick Garland does not deserve this position.
I understand that were in the midst of an especially volatile political season. But at a time when our politics are so polarized, we should treat a process of this magnitude  the appointment of a Supreme Court justice  with the seriousness it deserves.
Ive done my constitutional duty. Now its up to each senator to fulfill his or hers. All Im asking is simply for the Senate to act fairly. To act with the level-headedness and foresight required in our exercise in self-government. And to give Judge Garland  by all accounts an outstanding individual; someone with more experience on the federal bench than any Supreme Court nominee in history  the respect he has earned. Give him a hearing. Give him a vote.
To deny it would indicate a process for nominating and confirming judges that is beyond repair. It would make it increasingly impossible for any president, Republican or Democrat, to carry out their constitutional function. To go down that path would jeopardize our system of justice, hurt our democracy, and betray the vision of our founding.
We cant go down that road. So Im asking people here in California to make your voices heard. Let your senators know how important this is. Tell them that our courts should be above politics, not an extension of politics. Because this is bigger than a few news cycles, or even a single election. Its about the integrity of our system of justice. Its a question of whether or not well live up to the responsibilities our founders entrusted to us. Thats been the duty of Americans for more than two centuries. And now its up to us to carry forward that story for our time.

America is not the project of any one person.The single-most powerful word in our democracy is the word 'we.'"-President Obama
This is our record. This is the progress weve made.
The way ahead
WHEREVER I go these days, at home or abroad, people ask me the same question: what is happening in the American political system? How has a country that has benefitedperhaps more than any otherfrom immigration, trade and technological innovation suddenly developed a strain of anti-immigrant, anti-innovation protectionism? Why have some on the far left and even more on the far right embraced a crude populism that promises a return to a past that is not possible to restoreand that, for most Americans, never existed at all?
Its true that a certain anxiety over the forces of globalisation, immigration, technology, even change itself, has taken hold in America. Its not new, nor is it dissimilar to a discontent spreading throughout the world, often manifested in scepticism towards international institutions, trade agreements and immigration. It can be seen in Britains recent vote to leave the European Union and the rise of populist parties around the world.
Much of this discontent is driven by fears that are not fundamentally economic. The anti-immigrant, anti-Mexican, anti-Muslim and anti-refugee sentiment expressed by some Americans today echoes nativist lurches of the pastthe Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, the Know-Nothings of the mid-1800s, the anti-Asian sentiment in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and any number of eras in which Americans were told they could restore past glory if they just got some group or idea that was threatening America under control. We overcame those fears and we will again.
But some of the discontent is rooted in legitimate concerns about long-term economic forces. Decades of declining productivity growth and rising inequality have resulted in slower income growth for low- and middle-income families. Globalisation and automation have weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage. Too many potential physicists and engineers spend their careers shifting money around in the financial sector, instead of applying their talents to innovating in the real economy. And the financial crisis of 2008 only seemed to increase the isolation of corporations and elites, who often seem to live by a different set of rules to ordinary citizens.
So its no wonder that so many are receptive to the argument that the game is rigged. But amid this understandable frustration, much of it fanned by politicians who would actually make the problem worse rather than better, it is important to remember that capitalism has been the greatest driver of prosperity and opportunity the world has ever known.
Over the past 25 years, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty has fallen from nearly 40% to under 10%. Last year, American households enjoyed the largest income gains on record and the poverty rate fell faster than at any point since the 1960s. Wages have risen faster in real terms during this business cycle than in any since the 1970s. These gains would have been impossible without the globalisation and technological transformation that drives some of the anxiety behind our current political debate.
This is the paradox that defines our world today. The world is more prosperous than ever before and yet our societies are marked by uncertainty and unease. So we have a choiceretreat into old, closed-off economies or press forward, acknowledging the inequality that can come with globalisation while committing ourselves to making the global economy work better for all people, not just those at the top.
The profit motive can be a powerful force for the common good, driving businesses to create products that consumers rave about or motivating banks to lend to growing businesses. But, by itself, this will not lead to broadly shared prosperity and growth. Economists have long recognised that markets, left to their own devices, can fail. This can happen through the tendency towards monopoly and rent-seeking that this newspaper has documented, the failure of businesses to take into account the impact of their decisions on others through pollution, the ways in which disparities of information can leave consumers vulnerable to dangerous products or overly expensive health insurance.
More fundamentally, a capitalism shaped by the few and unaccountable to the many is a threat to all. Economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor and growth is broadly based. A world in which 1% of humanity controls as much wealth as the other 99% will never be stable. Gaps between rich and poor are not new but just as the child in a slum can see the skyscraper nearby, technology allows anyone with a smartphone to see how the most privileged live. Expectations rise faster than governments can deliver and a pervasive sense of injustice undermines peoples faith in the system. Without trust, capitalism and markets cannot continue to deliver the gains they have delivered in the past centuries.
This paradox of progress and peril has been decades in the making. While I am proud of what my administration has accomplished these past eight years, I have always acknowledged that the work of perfecting our union would take far longer. The presidency is a relay race, requiring each of us to do our part to bring the country closer to its highest aspirations. So where does my successor go from here?
Further progress requires recognising that Americas economy is an enormously complicated mechanism. As appealing as some more radical reforms can sound in the abstractbreaking up all the biggest banks or erecting prohibitively steep tariffs on importsthe economy is not an abstraction. It cannot simply be redesigned wholesale and put back together again without real consequences for real people.
Instead, fully restoring faith in an economy where hardworking Americans can get ahead requires addressing four major structural challenges: boosting productivity growth, combating rising inequality, ensuring that everyone who wants a job can get one and building a resilient economy thats primed for future growth.
First, in recent years, we have seen incredible technological advances through the internet, mobile broadband and devices, artificial intelligence, robotics, advanced materials, improvements in energy efficiency and personalised medicine. But while these innovations have changed lives, they have not yet substantially boosted measured productivity growth. Over the past decade, America has enjoyed the fastest productivity growth in the G7, but it has slowed across nearly all advanced economies (see chart 1). Without a faster-growing economy, we will not be able to generate the wage gains people want, regardless of how we divide up the pie.
A major source of the recent productivity slowdown has been a shortfall of public and private investment caused, in part, by a hangover from the financial crisis. But it has also been caused by self-imposed constraints: an anti-tax ideology that rejects virtually all sources of new public funding; a fixation on deficits at the expense of the deferred maintenance bills we are passing to our children, particularly for infrastructure; and a political system so partisan that previously bipartisan ideas like bridge and airport upgrades are nonstarters.
We could also help private investment and innovation with business-tax reform that lowers statutory rates and closes loopholes, and with public investments in basic research and development. Policies focused on education are critical both for increasing economic growth and for ensuring that it is shared broadly. These include everything from boosting funding for early childhood education to improving high schools, making college more affordable and expanding high-quality job training.
Lifting productivity and wages also depends on creating a global race to the top in rules for trade. While some communities have suffered from foreign competition, trade has helped our economy much more than it has hurt. Exports helped lead us out of the recession. American firms that export pay their workers up to 18% more on average than companies that do not, according to a report by my Council of Economic Advisers. So, I will keep pushing for Congress to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership and to conclude a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the EU. These agreements, and stepped-up trade enforcement, will level the playing field for workers and businesses alike.
Second, alongside slowing productivity, inequality has risen in most advanced economies, with that increase most pronounced in the United States. In 1979, the top 1% of American families received 7% of all after-tax income. By 2007, that share had more than doubled to 17%. This challenges the very essence of who Americans are as a people. We dont begrudge success, we aspire to it and admire those who achieve it. In fact, weve often accepted more inequality than many other nations because we are convinced that with hard work, we can improve our own station and watch our children do even better.
As Abraham Lincoln said, while we do not propose any war upon capital, we do wish to allow the humblest man an equal chance to get rich with everybody else. Thats the problem with increased inequalityit diminishes upward mobility. It makes the top and bottom rungs of the ladder stickierharder to move up and harder to lose your place at the top.
Economists have listed many causes for the rise of inequality: technology, education, globalisation, declining unions and a falling minimum wage. There is something to all of these and weve made real progress on all these fronts. But I believe that changes in culture and values have also played a major role. In the past, differences in pay between corporate executives and their workers were constrained by a greater degree of social interaction between employees at all levelsat church, at their childrens schools, in civic organisations. Thats why CEOs took home about 20- to 30-times as much as their average worker. The reduction or elimination of this constraining factor is one reason why todays CEO is now paid over 250-times more.
Economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor and growth is broadly based. This is not just a moral argument. Research shows that growth is more fragile and recessions more frequent in countries with greater inequality. Concentrated wealth at the top means less of the broad-based consumer spending that drives market economies.
America has shown that progress is possible. Last year, income gains were larger for households at the bottom and middle of the income distribution than for those at the top (see chart 2). Under my administration, we will have boosted incomes for families in the bottom fifth of the income distribution by 18% by 2017, while raising the average tax rates on households projected to earn over $8m per yearthe top 0.1%by nearly 7 percentage points, based on calculations by the Department of the Treasury. While the top 1% of households now pay more of their fair share, tax changes enacted during my administration have increased the share of income received by all other families by more than the tax changes in any previous administration since at least 1960.
Even these efforts fall well short. In the future, we need to be even more aggressive in enacting measures to reverse the decades-long rise in inequality. Unions should play a critical role. They help workers get a bigger slice of the pie but they need to be flexible enough to adapt to global competition. Raising the Federal minimum wage, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit for workers without dependent children, limiting tax breaks for high-income households, preventing colleges from pricing out hardworking students, and ensuring men and women get equal pay for equal work would help to move us in the right direction too.
Third, a successful economy also depends on meaningful opportunities for work for everyone who wants a job. However, America has faced a long-term decline in participation among prime-age workers (see chart 3). In 1953, just 3% of men between 25 and 54 years old were out of the labour force. Today, it is 12%. In 1999, 23% of prime-age women were out of the labour force. Today, it is 26%. People joining or rejoining the workforce in a strengthening economy have offset ageing and retiring baby-boomers since the end of 2013, stabilising the participation rate but not reversing the longer-term adverse trend.
Involuntary joblessness takes a toll on life satisfaction, self-esteem, physical health and mortality. It is related to a devastating rise of opioid abuse and an associated increase in overdose deaths and suicides among non-college-educated Americansthe group where labour-force participation has fallen most precipitously.
There are many ways to keep more Americans in the labour market when they fall on hard times. These include providing wage insurance for workers who cannot get a new job that pays as much as their old one. Increasing access to high-quality community colleges, proven job-training models and help finding new jobs would assist. So would making unemployment insurance available to more workers. Paid leave and guaranteed sick days, as well as greater access to high-quality child care and early learning, would add flexibility for employees and employers. Reforms to our criminal-justice system and improvements to re-entry into the workforce that have won bipartisan support would also improve participation, if enacted.
Finally, the financial crisis painfully underscored the need for a more resilient economy, one that grows sustainably without plundering the future at the service of the present. There should no longer be any doubt that a free market only thrives when there are rules to guard against systemic failure and ensure fair competition.
Post-crisis reforms to Wall Street have made our financial system more stable and supportive of long-term growth, including more capital for American banks, less reliance on short-term funding, and better oversight for a range of institutions and markets. Big American financial institutions no longer get the type of easier funding they got beforeevidence that the market increasingly understands that they are no longer too big to fail. And we created a first-of-its-kind watchdogthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureauto hold financial institutions accountable, so their customers get loans they can repay with clear terms up-front.
But even with all the progress, segments of the shadow banking system still present vulnerabilities and the housing-finance system has not been reformed. That should be an argument for building on what we have already done, not undoing it. And those who should be rising in defence of further reform too often ignore the progress we have made, instead choosing to condemn the system as a whole. Americans should debate how best to build on these rules, but denying that progress leaves us more vulnerable, not less so.
America should also do more to prepare for negative shocks before they occur. With todays low interest rates, fiscal policy must play a bigger role in combating future downturns; monetary policy should not bear the full burden of stabilising our economy. Unfortunately, good economics can be overridden by bad politics. My administration secured much more fiscal expansion than many appreciated in recovering from our crisismore than a dozen bills provided $1.4 trillion in economic support from 2009 to 2012but fighting Congress for each commonsense measure expended substantial energy. I did not get some of the expansions I sought and Congress forced austerity on the economy prematurely by threatening a historic debt default. My successors should not have to fight for emergency measures in a time of need. Instead, support for the hardest-hit families and the economy, like unemployment insurance, should rise automatically.
Maintaining fiscal discipline in good times to expand support for the economy when needed and to meet our long-term obligations to our citizens is vital. Curbs to entitlement growth that build on the Affordable Care Acts progress in reducing health-care costs and limiting tax breaks for the most fortunate can address long-term fiscal challenges without sacrificing investments in growth and opportunity.
Finally, sustainable economic growth requires addressing climate change. Over the past five years, the notion of a trade-off between increasing growth and reducing emissions has been put to rest. America has cut energy-sector emissions by 6%, even as our economy has grown by 11% (see chart 4). Progress in America also helped catalyse the historic Paris climate agreement, which presents the best opportunity to save the planet for future generations.
Americas political system can be frustrating. Believe me, I know. But it has been the source of more than two centuries of economic and social progress. The progress of the past eight years should also give the world some measure of hope. Despite all manner of division and discord, a second Great Depression was prevented. The financial system was stabilised without costing taxpayers a dime and the auto industry rescued. I enacted a larger and more front-loaded fiscal stimulus than even President Roosevelts New Deal and oversaw the most comprehensive rewriting of the rules of the financial system since the 1930s, as well as reforming health care and introducing new rules cutting emissions from vehicles and power plants.
The results are clear: a more durable, growing economy; 15m new private-sector jobs since early 2010; rising wages, falling poverty, and the beginnings of a reversal in inequality; 20m more Americans with health insurance, while health-care costs grow at the slowest rate in 50 years; annual deficits cut by nearly three-quarters; and declining carbon emissions.
For all the work that remains, a new foundation is laid. A new future is ours to write. It must be one of economic growth thats not only sustainable but shared. To achieve it America must stay committed to working with all nations to build stronger and more prosperous economies for all our citizens for generations to come.

Merrick Garland Champions Work In Public Service During Commencement Address
Despite the ongoing senatorial struggle over his confirmation, Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland spent his Memorial Day weekend urging the next generation to take up public service, calling such a decision among "the most rewarding" the judge has had. Garland was invited to his high school alma mater, Niles West High School, near Chicago over the weekend to deliver the commencement address to the class of 2016. During the speech, the 19-year veteran of the U.S.Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit made no mention of the political battle raging around his nomination, but rather, spoke to the trials life can bring after high school and the fulfillment brought on by a career helping others.
"Devote some part of your life to public service ... it does not matter what kind of public service you choose," said Garland, who graduated from Niles West in 1970. "At graduation I thought I was going to be a doctor. But after my college roommate ... finally let me know I really wasn't all that good at math, I shifted course and chose a career in law. Specifically a career devoting to building the kind of faith in rule of law that civil society depends on." Garland continued that there were many avenues to make a difference in the world, pointing to his work tutoring students at an elementary school. He later quoted one of his "favorite people," Harry Potter protagonist Hermione Granger, noting the character's hope "to do some good in the world."
"But as Professor Dumbledore once told Harry Potter: It is our choices that show what we truly are, more than our abilities," Garland said. So make the choice do to some good in the world." President Obama nominated Garland to the nation's highest court back in March, but Senate Republicans have largely refused to even meet with the well-regarded judge, let alone hold a confirmation hearing. Bucking any form of precedent, GOP stalwarts have called on such a decision to be made after the presidential election despite concern from the likes of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Take a look at Garland's entire speech above.

Secretary Moniz Releases Report Showing the Cost Reductions and Rapid Deployment of Clean Energy Technologies
WASHINGTON  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today released a new report that highlights the accelerated deployment of five clean energy technologies: wind turbines, solar technologies for both utility-scale and distributed photovoltaic (PV), electric vehicles (EVs) and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The report,RevolutionNow,was announced by Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz during a discussion atThe AtlanticsWashington Ideas Forum.
RevolutionNowis annually updated and describes the decreasing cost and increasing deployment of clean-energy technologies in the United States. As the world continues to move toward a low-carbon economy, this 2016 update released today builds upon last years edition and details the economic and environmental benefits our nation is already starting to realize thanks to the increased deployment.
This report is further proof that our commitment to clean energy and American innovation can lead to steep cost reductions and sharp increases in the deployment of advanced technologies, Secretary Moniz said. We need to continue pushing the innovation agenda that leads to these kinds of dramatic cost reductions for all low-carbon technologies and increases Americas competitiveness and independence in the global clean energy economy.
DOEs continued investments in the research and advancement of the five clean energy technologies highlighted inRevolutionNowhave contributed to price reductions from 40 percent to as high as 94 percent since 2008. Highlights from the report detail the dramatic increases in Americas clean energy deployment, which include:
Increased deployment of clean energy technologies is already revealing real-time benefits. Solar power saved 17 million metric tons of CO in 2014  leading to reduced water consumption and decreased air pollution that equate to nearly $700 million in environmental savings. LEDs use 85 percent less energy than incandescent bulbs and projections show that increased installation could allow for up to $630 billion in energy saving for Americans between now and 2035.
In addition to these five rapidly growing technologies, the report also discusses four emerging technologies.These additional technologies  fuel cells, grid-connected batteries, energy management systems and big area additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3-D printing  are on the cusp of wider deployment in the coming years. As these technologies become even more cost-effective and widely available, the economic and environmental benefits will grow.
DOE will continue its research and development for these core and emerging technologies as it works to further reduce market barriers and continue innovation that strengthen the clean energy revolution and transform the way in which our nation produces and uses energy.

One-third of all U.S. presidents appointed a Supreme Court justice in an election year
Eminent Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes famously described hisfellow judges as nine scorpions in a bottle, but now they are reduced to eight.Justice Antonin Scalias passing had hardly been made publicwhen Republicans began proclaiming that President Obama should not appoint the late justices successor. President Obama counteredthat he would perform his constitutional duty and nominate a successor to Scalia, adding, Your job doesnt stop until you are voted out or until your term expires.
The historical record supports that position: 14 presidents have appointed 21 justices during presidential election years. A half-dozen presidents, classic lame ducks, filled Supreme Court seats even though their successors had been elected.
These sixlame duck presidents appointed Supreme Court justices  before their successors took office
President Benjamin Harrison had been defeated in his 1892 reelection bid by former president Grover Cleveland, for example, when Associate Justice Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar died in office in January 1893. At that time, and until 1937 (and the 20th amendment), presidents were inaugurated in March, not January. While running for reelection, Harrison had appointed his third justice the previous July; he made a fourth nomination to the high court, despite his dwindling White House tenure. But Republican Harrison bowed to partisan realities by nominating his Democratic friend, Howell Jackson.
[Who should replace Scalia? No one. Heres why eight is enough.]
The Senate was soon to change hands from Republican to Democratic control, and Harrisons bipartisan gambit worked: The Senate unanimously approved Jackson one month before Clevelands inauguration.
This is why Judge Sri Srinivasan of the D.C. Circuit is receiving so much attention as a potential nominee to the nations highest tribunal. He served his judicial clerkships for Reagan appointees and moderate conservatives, 4th Circuit Court Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III and Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor, suggesting that he may have bipartisan appeal. He was born in India and grew up in Kansas, a compelling story of the American dream  and having the first Indian American justice replace the first Italian American on the Supreme Court would maintain a historic symmetry.
Further, the fact that Srinivasan is Hindu would add religious diversity to a bench populated solely by Catholic or Jewish justices for the past sixyears, and would follow a long presidential tradition of placing religious minorities on the Supreme Court long before that religion was represented in high elected office. Srinivasan more than meets the standard of exceptional merit, with his Stanford degrees and professional experience. And the Republican-controlled Senate approved him unanimously when Obama nominated him for the D.C. Circuit, a Supreme Court proving ground, in 2013.
[Should this Senate fill Justice Scalias seat? Beware the argle-bargle.]
Although Benjamin Harrison was the most recent lame duck to place a justice on the Supreme Court, five other presidents (Hayes, Tyler, Van Buren, Jackson and Adams) did so as well. All but Jackson, who named a justice on the last full day of his two terms, had been defeated or had withdrawn from the election. Adamss last-minute appointment of his Secretary of State John Marshall to chief justice, a parting Federalist slap at the Jeffersonians, makes todays partisan rows look tame by comparison. That gloomy malignity, as Thomas Jefferson inaccurately described Marshall, would preside over the court for 34 years, long after the Federalist Party faded from the scene. The Supreme Court labels him the Great Chief Justice for his masterful leadership and foundational interpretations of the Constitution.
One-third of U.S. presidents appointed Supreme Court justices during election years
Aside from genuine lame ducks, one-third of U.S. presidents appointed justices during presidential election years. A handful were, like Obama, not running for reelection. George Washington, who established precedents that shape the office to this day, declined to run for a third term, but he added an associate justice and a chief justice during the election year of 1796.
Jackson and Cleveland followed the two-term tradition, and each appointed two members of the Supreme Court in the election year before leaving office. Like Obama, Jackson faced an obstinate Senate, which had postponed a vote on his nominee Roger Taney for an associate justice position early in 1835. Old Hickory renominated Taney nearly a year later, this time to chief justice, upon the death of John Marshall. Taney, the Courts first Catholic, assumed his seat just sevenmonths before the 1836 presidential election.
Three presidents who appointed Supreme Court justices in an election year (Hoover, Taft and B. Harrison) were running for reelection but ultimately lost. If Hoover hadnt replaced retiring Justice Holmes in February 1932, the court might have been denied the intellectual services of Benjamin Cardozo, by all accounts a stellar justice. Hoover faced a closely divided Senate, but Cardozo was so universally admired that his confirmation was unanimous.
[Heres how an Obama Supreme Court nominee could win confirmation]
William Howard Taft, who would lose his 1912 reelection campaign, achieved the position he most coveted, chief justice of the United States, when appointed to the high court by Warren Harding in 1921. In an interesting twist, Taft served on the Supreme Court with the associate justice, Mahlon Pitney, whom he had appointed in his last year before leaving the White House.
Franklin Roosevelt and fourother presidents (Nixon, Eisenhower, Wilson, Cleveland and Jefferson) placed justices on the Supreme Court during election years that led them to a second term. Ike faced an opening just three weeks before the 1956 election when Justice Sherman Minton left the bench in ill health. Looking for support from the electoral-vote rich Northeast, Eisenhower immediately selected William Brennan, a New Jersey Catholic, in a recess appointment. Catholics, a key component of the FDRs New Deal coalition, were also represented in FDRs 1940 election-year nomination of Frank Murphy to fill the seat of deceased Catholic justice Pierce Butler.
Nixons two appointments in 1972 of William Rehnquist and Lewis Powell carried out his campaign promise to reshape the court to counter the liberal Warren-era decisions, and contributed to his landslide victory over George McGovern. Nixon couldnt have predicted that a mere two years later, his reshaped bench would unanimously rule against him in the Watergate tapes case, with only Rehnquist recusing himself.
Two other presidents (Lincoln and Grant) named Supreme Court members after they had been reelected but before their second inauguration. When Roger Taney died in late 1864, after 32 years on the bench, Lincoln happily replaced the Jacksonian chief justice with his Republican Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase.
The founding fathers debatedhow Supreme Court justices should be appointed
Justice Scalias 30-year tenure confirms President Gerald Fords observation that few appointments a president makes can have as much impact on the future of the country as those to the Supreme Court. That truism, even more apposite now when the Court is evenly split on the most contentious political issues of the day, explains why the Founding Fathers spent so much time debating the process of selecting justices.
[When was the last Supreme Court nomination in which stakes were this high? Maybe never.]
Nearly silent on judicial qualifications, the founders gave considerable thought at Philadelphias 1787 constitutional convention to the best method of choosing them. The delegates initially considered appointment of federal judges by the national legislature. Pennsylvanias James Wilson, a future member of the Court, opposed the proposal, arguing that [i]ntrigue, partiality, and concealment resulted from judicial appointments by legislatures.
Future president James Madison, often called the Father of the Constitution, added that members of the legislature were not judges of the requisite qualifications for jurists. Wilson thought that the newly created office of the president should have sole authority to choose judges, but John Rutledge of South Carolina thought that plan too monarchical.
As so frequently happened at the convention, perhaps because it operated in secret, the delegates reached a compromise, eventually settling on nomination to the Supreme Court by the president, with appointment contingent on the Senates prerogative to advise and consent.
While the exact nature of that prerogative has been endlessly debated, the original intent of the Constitutions framers, which the late Justice Scalia squarely embraced, was to produce qualified Supreme Court justices by checking and balancing the ambitions inherent in the chief executive and Congresss upper house. It was not to allow the voter (even the white, male, landed-gentry electorate of that era) a direct role.

Weekly Address: Standing with Orlando
Weekly Address: We Will Not Be Terrorized
A response to your petition from Vice President Biden on banning the AR-15 from civilian ownership: | We the People: Your Voice in Our Government
Over the past few years, we've watched as new horrific shootings have replaced previous ones as the deadliest in our nation's history.
We've waged campaign after campaign to turn our grief into action  each time thinking maybe, just maybe, this will be the one that breaks through. This will be the one that gets through to Congress, which must ultimately act. We've used phrases like Now is the Time. Stop Gun Violence. Enough is Enough.
Folks, enough has been enough for a long time.
You know that. On Monday, in the wake of this latest, deadliest, mass shooting, you started this petition. You worked together, calling on your government to ban AR-15-type weapons from civilian ownership. In the days following, we have seen members of the United States Senate take and hold the floor, refusing to back down, refusing to concede that we might need to wait for an even bigger national tragedy to finally make some changes.
To the creator and signers of this petition, I want to say this as plainly and clearly as possible: The President and I agree with you. Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines should be banned from civilian ownership.
When a lone gunman walked into a Century movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, he carried a Smith & Wesson M&P 15 -- a variation of the AR-15 rifle -- modified to hold as many as 100 bullets. He used it to kill 12 people and injure 70.
And when a lone gunman walked into a classroom at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, he carried a version of the AR-15. He used it -- and several handguns -- to kill 10 of his fellow students and injure nine.
And when a lone gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, he carried a Bushmaster XM 15 -- another version of the AR-15 -- and multiple high-capacity magazines. He used it to kill 20 innocent children and six educators with 154 bullets in five minutes.
A single person killed that many people in just a few minutes. Not in a war zone. Here in America -- in a classroom.
These weapons have been used to commit horrific acts. They've been called "the perfect killing machines." They fire bullets at incredible speed that rip through bodies and cause devastating carnage, and can accommodate high-capacity magazines that allow them to effectively shoot up to 45 rounds per minute. We've seen their tragic results play out in our death tolls and in the thousands left wounded, struggling to recover.
As we learned this week from the family of the guns inventor, he himself did not intend that this gun be used by civilians, only by our soldiers in combat -- giving them an advantage over the AK-47. He didnt own one himself. Here is what his family said:
"We think he would have been horrified and sickened as anyone, if not more, by these events."
Right now, these weapons are on the shelves in gun shops around the country, completely legal for civilians to purchase. They can be purchased in a matter of mere minutes. That should not be so.
Here's a start: We should renew the assault weapons ban that Congress passed in 1994  but which expired ten years later. That ban, which covered 19 specific assault-style weapons, was included in a comprehensive crime bill that folded together three pieces of legislation. I remember it well. I was Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time. I wrote much of the bill and led it through Congress  with the help of many others, especially Senator Feinstein on the assault weapons ban. I argued strongly in favor of banning these weapons. What's more, 46 House Republicans voted for that ban in 1994. Forty-six.
So what happened to that bill? To use a somewhat wonkish legislative term, it was "sunsetted." That means that this bill came with an expiration date: Ten years after its passage, it would need to be renewed. Under President Bush and a Republican Congress, the bill lapsed. And it hasn't been renewed since.
But renewing the ban on assault weapons isnt the only thing Congress should do to help prevent the tragedy of gun violence around the country.
It could require that every buyer go through a background check before getting a gun -- to make sure dangerous weapons dont end up in the hands of criminals or other people who have long been prohibited from possessing them. It could prevent people who are suspected of having terrorist ties and cant get on a plane from buying weapons of war -- thats just common sense. It could ensure that domestic abusers cant go to the store to buy a gun -- filling the kinds of gaps in the law that leave too many innocent victims dead. It could end the freeze on gun violence research, so our public health experts can collect data and facts that would inform strategies to deal with this epidemic. And it could give law enforcement officials the tools and resources the President requested in his budget proposal -- so they can take dangerous criminals off the street and enforce our gun laws. Our Administration has done what it can. So have many cities, counties, and states.
Now its up to Congress to do its job.
They'll have a good opportunity this Monday, when the Senate is set to vote on a number of different gun safety measures -- votes that came about after that 15-hour filibuster, during which a series of Democratic senators refused to cede the floor. The measures they will vote on would address the fact that anyone on a terrorist watch list can still legally purchase guns and explosives. They will address the current background check requirements for prospective gun buyers.
Ahead of those votes, we'd like to invite you to join a call on Monday, June 20th at 1pm EST for We the People signers with Valerie Jarrett on how we can continue to come together as citizens around this issue. Let us know you'll be joining right here  and ask any questions you've got, or issues you'd like to hear raised on the call.
I encourage you to pay attention to Monday's votes. Make yourselves aware. Use your voice. Make yourselves impossible to ignore.
Because youre not alone in recognizing the need to act -- to take steps, consistent with the Second Amendment -- that will keep our children and communities safe. Here's who else agrees with you: The Department of Justice. Dozens of United States Senators. Faith leaders, law enforcement officials, and responsible businesses. Public health experts. And the vast majority of the American people, including the vast majority of gun owners in the country.
If taking commonsense steps to reduce gun violence had the potential to save even one life, it would be worth doing. But it has the potential to save far more than that.
You know that. And that is why you spoke up. That matters. But the fact is that we have three separate but equal branches of a government for a reason.
And so, to speak directly to those members of Congress who, in the wake of this most recent, most horrific killing of our citizens, might be considering stepping up and getting this done once and for all, I'd like to remind you that this will not stop on its own. It will not stop. In the three and a half years since Newtown, there have been at least 1,002 mass shootings in this country. At least 1,135 people killed, and 3,953 wounded. That includes 49 killed and 53 wounded in Orlando.
You know in your heart that this is the right thing to do. You know that by stepping up, your action has the potential to create a domino effect. Have the courage to do it.
We have done it before. We can do it again.
Energy By The Numbers: Recovery Act

Americans say by 2-to-1 that Senate should hold hearings on Obamas Supreme Court nominee
Democrats are hoping to make Senate elections in a handful of swing and blue states a referendum on Republicans' Supreme Court blockade, and new polling suggests they may have a shot.
According to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll, a sizable majority of Americans including a strong contingent of independents  think the Senate should at least hold hearings on President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court confirmation battle has become intensely partisan, so the numbers break down somewhat along partisan lines. But it's notable that by a margin of nearly 2-to-1, independents side with Democrats on this. Among independents, 62 percent say the Senate should hold hearings, while 32 percent say the Senate should not. And even Republicans are pretty evenly split.
There's even more good news for Democrats, who appear to be benefiting fromstronger emotions favoring their side.
Among all voters, 44 percent say they strongly feel the Senate should hold hearings, while just 25 percent say they feel strongly the Senate shouldn't. Republicans might also suffer from an enthusiasm gap on this issue: While 79 percent of Democrats agree with their partys leadership on holding hearings for an Obama nominee, just about half of Republicans (49 percent) agree with their partys leadership in Congress .
Within hours of Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) drew a line in the sand on holding hearingsor taking a vote. He declared that the Senate won't consider Obama's nominee this late in his presidency and will wait for the next president to be elected.
Senate Republicans argue it's only fair to let the people decide which presidential candidate gets to pick the person who couldreshape the court's ideological makeup for decades. Republicans'somewhat-risky political calculation here is that by blockingObama's nominee, theycan get their guy in the White House and have control over who gets on the court.
The flip side is that voters will sour on what Democrats sayis a blatantly partisan move. They arguethat toblock a sitting president's nominee before he or she is nominated  for nearly a year is unprecedented. The nominee at least deserves hearings or even a vote, they say.(This is a good time to reiterate that The Washington Post only asked whether Americans think Obama's nominee should get a hearing, and not necessarily a vote.)
Perhaps buoyed by numbers like this, Democrats are trying to make the confirmation process  or the lack of one  a central feature of their campaign to take back the Senate.
A Harry Reid-affiliated Super PAC is running an ad in New Hampshire tying Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R) to GOP front-runner Donald Trump, who has also said the Senate should consider the next president's nominee over Obama's. And Democrats have convinceda former lieutenant governorto challenge the once-unchallengeable Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who in his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee is taking most of the heat for blocking Obama's nominee.
The efficacy of Democrats' Supreme Courtstrategy is to be determined. (For example, do voters actually care about the relatively arcane confirmation process?) But data like this suggest theymay have an opening, at least with that crucial sliver of truly independent, undecided voters.
ThePost-ABC poll was conducted March 3-6 among a random national sample of 1,000 adults, including interviews onlandline and cellular phones. The margin of sampling error for overall results is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

President Obama: America is leading the way on climate change
Celebrating 100 years of the National Park Service
By Secretary of the Interior SallyJewell From the halls of an Arkansas high school that forever changed the course of the nations ongoing fight for racial equality to glaciers melting at alarming rates because of climate change in Glacier National Park to the Roosevelt Arch, gateway to Americas first national parkthis week I will visit public lands across the country to mark the 100th anniversary of the National Park Service. With more than 400 places that make up the most incredible park system on the planet, these natural, historical and cultural treasures show the wide range of what the National Park Service preserves, promotes and protects for future generations to enjoy. Thursday we will rededicate the Roosevelt Arch in Yellowstone that has witnessed millions of visitors from the furthest reaches of the globe who come to marvel at the majesty of Wonderland from sky-high geysers to majestic wildlife.
It is fitting to celebrate the National Park Service on its 100th birthday at the first national park, but the Centennial is also an incredible opportunity to foster the next generation of park visitors, advocates and stewards to ensure the National Park Service remains an inspiration to the worldwhere our nations treasures and the places that tell our stories of triumph and struggle welcome visitors from all walks of life. We have made great strides with President Obamas Every Kid in a Park initiative that gives 4th graders and their families free access to all public lands across the country, and we have invited every American to get outdoors and #FindYourPark throughout the Centennial year. We also continue our efforts to make national parks relevant to all Americans. President Obama designated Csar Chvez National Monument in 2012 to honor the civil rights leader and the farm labor movement. On Wednesday, I will tour the site with Latino leaders and hold a community town hall discussion on ways to engage more diverse audiences. Some of my favorite moments as Secretary have been spending time with young people on public lands to watch their love of parks grow. In Minnesota on Friday I look forward to getting out on the river with youth from Outdoor Afro in Mississippi National River & Recreation Areaa natural oasis full of wildlife in a densely populated urban area.
Our national parks are a living, breathing history book of American culture and heritage. In New York on Monday, Ill tour the Hudson River Valley National Heritage Area to discuss how historic preservation is boosting tourism and fueling local economies, while telling important stories about our journey. With a nod to the innovative spirit of Thomas Edison National Historical Park and to inspire new generations of park enthusiasts, Monday night well join Bill Nye the Science Guy to illuminate the New York City skyline from Brooklyn Bridge Park by controlling the color of the One World Trade Center Spire for the first time ever through interactive, collaborative puzzles on a giant circuit board. As Americas storyteller, its also important for the National Park Service to add new chaptersnot just those that make us proud, but also those that teach us painful lessons from which tolearn. At Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site, the National Park Service preserves the history of nine high school students who played a crucial role in the desegregation of public schools. I will join two members on Tuesday of the original Little Rock Nine, who personally integrated the then-segregated school, to discuss how far we have come as a country and how far we still have to travel. National Guard escorts Little Rock Nine into Little Rock Central High School. Photo from National Archives. In the past year, we have seen President Obama designate Belmont-Paul Womens Equality National Monument, which was home to the National Womans Party for 90 years and epicenter of the struggle for womens suffrage and womens rights. He also designated Stonewall National Monument to preserve the history of the Stonewall uprisinga milestone in the quest for LGBT civil rights that provided momentum for a movement.
During the next century of conservation, we must also continue to tackle the greatest challenges before us so our grandchildren and future generations can experience the quiet of the night pierced by the howl of wolves that once again roam Yellowstone; feel the first rays of sun while catching the sunrise on Cadillac Mountain in Acadia; or try in vain to wrap their little arms around the old growth trees in the Pacific Northwest. Climate changethe most pressing issue of our timethreatens our land and waters in existential ways, with longer, hotter fire seasons, record-breaking droughts, and more frequent and severe superstorms. Nowhere is this more visible than Glacier National Park where climate change threatens to melt giant masses of ice for which the park is named, potentially within decades. I will tour the park with scientists and stakeholders on Wednesday to better understand how to mitigate against climate change and reverse this dangerous trend.
All Americans are encouraged to use this special year of the National Park Services Centennial to not only reflect on the last 100 years, but use it as a catalyst to make the next century that much brighter. If we remain committed to doing this, future generations will visit national parks that tell stories as inclusive as our nation is diverse. Our parks will steal their breath as they gaze at amazing landscapes we refused to lose to the devastating effects of climate change. They will be reminded of the struggles our country faced and how we persevered on our march toward a more perfect union. All Americansno matter where they come from, how they worship or who they lovewill see themselves in these public lands and feel they can take part in caring for these treasured assets as though they were their own, because they are! When looking back at the past 100 years and all we have accomplished by working together, Im eternally optimistic about the next century of conservation. I look forward to seeing you outdoors as you #FindYourPark this year and every year to come.

Obama administration expands climate fight with proposed rules for oil and gas drilling
The Obama administration took a step Friday toward plugging thousands of small methane leaks from oil and gas operations around the country, saying the escaping gas is contributing to climate change.
The Interior Department announced proposed regulations that would require energy companies to reduce methane leaks in order to drill anywhere on land owned by the government or Native American tribes. The proposals would affect more than 100,000 oil wells that supply about 10 percent of the nations natural gas.
A combination of accidental leaks and deliberate venting or flaring of methane gas from public and Native American lands released about 375 billion cubic feet of methane into the atmosphere between 2009 and 2014, according to government estimates. The leaks waste a valuable resource  the lostmethane could have supplied energy for5.1 million U.S. homes for a year  while also putting more heat-trapping greenhouse gases in to the atmosphere, U.S. officials say.
I think most people would agree that we should be using our nations natural gas to power our economy  not wasting it by venting and flaring it into the atmosphere, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in announcing the proposal. We need to modernize decades-old standards to reflect existing technologies so that we can cut down on harmful methane emissions.
[Leaks contribute to a Delaware-sized methane plume over New Mexico]
The proposed regulations  which are opposed by the oil and gas industry  are the latest in a series of initiatives aimed at lowering U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases, which scientists say are contributing to a dangerous warming of the planet.The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to announce similar curbs for other oil and gas operations as part of an administration-wide effort to reduce U.S. emissions of methane gas by at least 40 percent by the year 2025, compared to 2012 levels.
Methane, the main component in natural gas, is about 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping the suns heat in the lower atmosphere, according to EPA estimates. But methane also dissipates relatively quickly in a few decades, compared to centuries for carbon dioxide. Scientists say rapidly cutting methane pollution can buy the worlds nations more time to tackle the bigger challenge of reducing carbon emissions.
The Interior Department rules, if finalized, would impose new limits on venting and flaring  or burning off  of excess natural gas, a common practice in the oil and gas industry that prevents the buildup of pressure on wellheads. The proposals also sets standards for equipment by used energy companies and requires more frequent inspections to check for leaks, in the first significant update of the Interior Departments regulations on methane in three decades.
Administration officials estimate that the regulations would prevent the loss about at least $115 million worth of methane a year, more than offsetting the equipment costs.
The gas saved would be enough to supply every household in the cities of Dallas and Denver combined, every year, said Neil Kornze, director of the Bureau of Land Management, the agency that oversees the bulk of government-owned lands in Western states.
Industry officials criticized the proposals as burdensome and unnecessary, saying energy companies already are adopting voluntary measures to prevent the loss of valuable methane.
Another duplicative rule at a time when methane emissions are already falling  and on top of an onslaught of other new BLM and EPA regulations  could drive more energy production off federal lands, said Erik Milito, director of upstream and industry operations for the American Petroleum Institute, the largest trade association for oil and gas companies. That means less federal revenue, fewer jobs, higher costs for consumers, and less energy security.
But environmentalists and watchdog groups praised the proposal as a boon for taxpayers and the environment.
For too long, oil and gas companies have been allowed to waste billions of cubic feet in natural gas and avoid paying hundreds of millions in royalties, said Ryan Alexander, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a fiscal watchdog group.
Josh Mantell, carbon management campaign manager for The Wilderness Society, applauded the proposed rule as a significant step in controlling greenhouse gas emissions. These guidelines would have the added benefit of reducing pollution that causes disease and emissions that contribute to climate change, Mantell said.

What You Need to Know About How President Obama is Fighting Climate Change
The Final State of the Union
Weekly Address: America Can Do Anything
Climate Change Is the Mother of All Risks' to National Security
Jon Powers, an Iraq Veteran, served as the Federal Chief Sustainability Officer and Special Advisor on Energy to the US Army in the Obama Administration, and is currently Managing Director of Public Sector Business Development with Bloom Energy.
Serving at Pentagon, I worked with leaders who studied threats ranging from insurgent groups to rogue states. One of the U.S. militarys less-noticed findings, however, is that there is clear consensus that climate change poses an immediate risk to national security.
Military leaders recognize that they must lead by example and address the threat of climate change, and they are actively pushing goals to dramatically scale up renewable energy. The U.S. must replicate this leadership and seize the opportunity when countries meet this December in Paris to finalize a global deal on climate change.
To the military, climate change acts as a threat multiplier, exacerbating threats in already unstable regions of the world. Just as we act aggressively on information from the national security intelligence community, we must also act on the scientific evidence from our nations best climate scientists.
In the security world, decisions are made by a careful evaluation of risk. And climate change is the mother of all risks. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned last year, without action on climate change, our children and grandchildren will face severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts.
The U.S. is already suffering from the impacts of climate change. In 2014 alone, there were eight extreme weather and climate events with losses of more than $1 billion. California is currently facing one of the worst droughts on record, and sea-level rise threatens some of the U.S. most critical military installations. Without a global agreement in Paris, the worldincluding the U.S.is headed toward potentially catastrophic climate impacts.
Its clear that no country can avoid the impacts of climate change, and no country can meet this challenge alone.
Thats why a bipartisan group of 48 national security and foreign policy leadersincluding three former Secretaries of Defense and two former Secretaries of Staterecently issued a statement urging the highest levels of American government and business to take domestic and international action to fight climate change.
Fortunately, the agreement that will be negotiated in Paris is one the U.S. should be proud to get behind. More than 150 countries have submitted plans for how they plan to tackle climate change domestically, including countries once reluctant to act, like China and India. American leadership has been key to getting us to getting these countries on board and agreeing to do their fair share. These countries are also acting because its in their self-interest to do sofor their own health and security.
America stands to benefit from a global climate agreement. An agreement in Paris would unleash clean energy innovation in the U.S., putting us back in control of our energy security. Our country is well-poised to lead in a global clean energy economy. The U.S. was the second largest investor in renewable energy in 2014, and in September the Obama Administration announced $120 million worth of funding for renewable energy innovation. And the Department of Defense has led the way here as well, from developing advanced biofuels to building clean energy bases.
The investment signal Paris would send on clean energy would create jobs here at home, one of the reasons businesses and investors have also been vocal in their support for action in Paris.
Last month, 81 companies with more than nine million employees working across all 50 states signed the American Business Act on Climate pledge, which declares support for an ambitious agreement in Paris and commits to a range of action including investment in renewable energy. Representing a combined $3 trillion in annual revenue, the backing of these companies should show all of us what U.S. leadership on climate is delivering: real progress on a global problem, underpinned by implementable solutions that many here and abroad strongly support.
America has always led on great challenges, and climate change should be no exception. A strong global climate agreement in Paris would usher in a clean energy economy while building a safer, stronger America.

OFA's Organizing Directors Summit
Grassroots organizations build winning campaigns by empowering supporters on the ground. But that's easier said than done. Person-to-person organizing is hard, time-consuming, and often takes a lot of investment in people and relationships.Most advocacy organizations have someone on their senior management team who helps manage all of the staff and volunteers that power the workthis person is typically called a grassroots director, organizing director, or field director. Although many of them spend hundreds of hours coaching others, there aren't many opportunities in progressive politics for these leaders to learn from each other and build meaningful partnerships.That's why earlier this month, OFA hosted organizing directors from around the country to participate in a collaborative summit in Chicago. From organizations large and small, grassroots managers came together to work on some of the biggest challenges they face every day.Working in teams, the directors were able to help each other find solutions to specific organizing challenges they were facing. "I feel like I'm coming away today with really concrete ways to test and implement organizing ideas, Virginia of Green Corps said."Today what I found most valuable was connecting with other organizing directors like myself and getting reinvigorated to solve some of the problems that we all face, said Patty Dillon of Equality Illinois.Although it's not always easy, it's important for organizers at every level to use each other as resources and to set aside the time to keep learning. These professional organizers came from all over the country to learn from one another and to work on real challenges. But you don't have to be an organizing director to become a better organizer. You can improve your skills and learn from experienced organizers around the country.Get in touch with organizers from all over the country by joining Connect, OFA's community organizing tool.

2016 State of the Union
When President Obama took office, we were facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Seven years later, our businesses have created 14.1 million new jobs over the past 70 months.Weve rebuilt our manufacturing base, reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector. Weve welcomed home more than 160,000 troops.
We are living through an extraordinary moment in human history. Technological and social change is reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our environment, and our place in the world.But as Americans, weve been through big changes before and, like generations past, we can make change work for us. In his speech, President Obama laid out his plan to seize opportunities before us.In looking forward, there are four big questions that we as a country have to answer.
How do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in the new economy?
How do we make technology work for us, and not against us, as we solve our biggest challenges?
How do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?
How can we make our politics reflect the best in us, and not the worst?
For all the challenges we face, the truth is that no country on Earth is better poised to seize the future than the United States.And if we answer these four basic questions, then there is nothing that America cant do.

With Stonewall, Obama designates first national monument to gay rights movement
President Obama on Friday designated the first national monument to the gay rights movement, commemorating the Stonewall uprising in New York City nearly five decades ago.
Using his executive authority under the 1906 Antiquities Act, Obama protected a7.7-acre area in Greenwich Village that encompasses the Stonewall Inn,Christopher Park and a maze of surrounding streets that were the place of rioting in late June 1969.
The site memorializes the six-day uprising that started June 28 after police raided the Stonewall Inn, a Mafia-owned bar frequented by gay men. While patrons of the bar had complied in the past with these crackdowns, that raidsparked a spontaneous riot by bystanders and those who had been detained.
[Was Stonewall sparked by Judy Garlands death? Inside the riots contested history]
"Raids like this were nothing new, but this time the patrons had had enough, so they stood up and spoke out," the president said in a video the White House released Friday. "The riots became protests, the protests became a movement, and the movement ultimately became an integral part of America."
Although national monument designations are partly symbolic, they inevitably spur an increase in visitation as well as interest in a site online. Backers of the move said it could bolster the fight against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, which led to the landmark 2015 Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.
The designation of Stonewall reflects the ongoing cultural shift that the national park system has experienced duringObama's presidency, as the president useshis executive authority to recognize sites that resonate with the countrys diverse makeup. Some of his previous designations have singled out places that correspond to seminal moments for African Americans, women, Latinos, Native Americans and Asian Americans, or are located near communities of color.
"I believe our national parks should reflect the full story of our country, the richness and diversity and uniquely American spirit that has always defined us," Obama says in the video, which will play on billboards in Times Square at noon Saturday, "that we are stronger together, that out of many, we are one."
[Why Obama chose Stonewall as the nation's first LGBT national monument]
Theresa Pierno, president and chief executive of the National Parks Conservation Association, said in an interview that the push to make Stonewall a national monument has helped bring people to the issue in a very intimate way, as both people who had participated in the riots and a younger generation of LGBT Americans rallied to the cause.
The bar--a different one is now in operation, in half the original space--and the area surrounding it continue to draw people during critical moments affecting gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, including in the aftermath of this months mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando.
People went to Stonewall, and thats where they held vigils, because thats where they connect to their history, Pierno said.
Still, rarely has the president of the United States honored a place that represents such a radical rebellion against the status quo. During the initial stage of the riots, participants rammed a parking meter through the inn and tossed in molotov cocktails, while another set of protesters kicked up their legs in a chorus line to mock the police.
Philip Bockman, who was 27when he took part in the riots, had grown up isolated in Michigan withnoconception of what it meant to be gay. After being thrown out of the University of Michigan because officials there suspected that hewas gay, he moved to New York City and began frequenting gay bars that remained shrouded in secrecy.
But at the start of the riots, Bockman realized how he and other gaypeoplecould exercise their political power. Looking around that crowd, I thought, wow, theres a lot of us, he recalled. It was the end of my loneliness.
At times, Bockman added, he and others were reckless.
I ran up and down the streets, I was telling people Come out, come out!  he said, making an allusion to both being open about ones sexual orientation as well as inviting others to take part in the riots.
Tommy Lanigan-Schmidt, another of the original participants, described the conditions for LBGT Americans before the riots as prehistoric.
And when Stonewall happens, history begins for us. Our history, defined by us, Lanigan-Schmidt said. Thats the difference, its us, saying who we are. Its not other people deciding that were sick, or should be felt sorry for, or all these things. The world before Stonewall was very much like the world that the Christian right would want it to be today.
David Carter, author of "Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Gay Revolution," said gay homeless youths, such as Lanigan-Schmidt, as well as a lesbian who resisted arrest, were the ones who set off rioting at first. "The explosion that happened was with the most marginalized members of society," Carter said.
Unlike other presidential landdesignations, which can sometimes spark local opposition, theStonewall National Monument received near-unanimous support from local, state and federal lawmakers. Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) collaborated with federal officials and thoserepresenting Greenwich Village on the New York City Council and the state assembly and senateto arrange a land transfer to the federal government.
"We are faced with painful reminders daily of how much further we must go to achieve true equality and tolerance for the LGBT community, but honoring and preserving the stories of all of the diverse participants in Stonewall in our National Park System is a clear symbol of how far we have come," said Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who authored legislation with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) to make the area a national park.
Some Christian leaders have criticized the idea of creating an LGBT monument, saying the U.S. government should not honor anything associated with homosexuality.
The National Park Foundation haschartereda new nonprofit group tohelp raise money to support the site, funding dedicated National Park Service personnel, a temporary ranger station and a visitor center. As of Monday, four NPS rangers from the New York area will be detailed to the site on a short-term basis, administration officials said.
Bockman said it was important to recognize Stonewall not to convey its importance for both straight Americans and younger people who are out, but for those who dont know what they take for granted about their current rights.
It feels like it legitimizes me as a U.S. citizen, as a human being, as part of our country in a way that Ive never been able to fully feel before, he said, adding that while he lives in Philadelphia, he visits Stonewall nearly every week when he commutes to Manhattan to see patients in his psychotherapy practice. Its my past, its my youth, and its our movement.

Mayors to Congress: Get a Backbone and Pass Gun Control
The mayors of Americas cities are deeply concerned about rising crime and homicide ratesand deeply frustrated with the Congress continued inaction on gun control amid a spate of mass shootings. Stronger gun regulation is needed right now, mayors say, and Congress has hung them out to dry. Senators and representatives will not be able to escape responsibility for the deaths of innocent Americans, said Mayor Stephanie Miner of Syracuse, New York.
Failure to address an issue that amounts to slow-motion mass murder of American citizens, many of whom are black and brown, is political cowardice. Stand up! Do the right thing, said Mayor Sly James of Kansas City, Missouri.
Chula Vista Mayor Mary Salas said she had a simple message for Congress: Get a backbonedo your job.
Those answers were part of an exclusive Politico Magazine survey, which also found that more than 90 percent of mayors say that Congress is doing too little on issues of firearm regulation and gun violence. As Tom Barrett, the mayor of Milwaukee, a city that has seen a surging homicide rate this year, implored: Stand up against the fear-mongering NRA. That emotion was seconded by Grand Rapids, Michigan, Mayor George Heartwell, who said, Buck up and stand up to the NRA. Listen to the voice of the people of America.
The mayor of Stamford, Connecticut, was even more blunt to Congress: Just do it.
The answers come from Politico Magazines third installment of an ongoing national Mayors Survey, part of the award-winning What Works series. The survey garnered responses from 45 mayors across the country, from Las Vegas to Tallahassee, Houston to San Francisco, Phoenix to Chattanooga, Grand Rapids to Portland, Maine. While not scientific (the large majority of respondents, 85 percent, were Democrats, joined by four independents and three Republicans), the survey represents an array of cities about as diverse as size, politics and geography can allow, including states of every huered, blue and purple.
Nearly across the board, the urban and suburban mayorswhere the vast preponderance of the nations crime and gun violence occurswere disturbed by rising homicide trends; 91 percent of the mayors said they were either deeply concerned or concerned about crime and homicide trends in their city. One in four of the mayors surveyed said their city had suffered a mass shooting incident since they came into officeand those mayors were substantially more likely to say they were deeply concerned about crime and shootings.
We are losing an entire American generation to this endless cycle of violence, said Mayor Mitch Landreiu of New Orleans. Its a direct threat to our national well-being and security.
The time to act is now, Richmond, Virginia, Mayor Dwight Jones said. We cannot wait to continue to allow illegals guns to subvert our neighborhoods and communities.
Such fears now lie at the heart of an inflamed national debate over the proper role of government in regulating guns. Twenty years ago, it was the federal government that took the lead in creating such policy, passing landmark legislation such as the so-called Brady Bill and the federal Assault Weapons Ban of the 1990s. Cities followed suit, passing longstanding handgun bans like those in Washington, D.C., and Chicago. But a changing national moodaccompanied by the astonishing rise and power of groups like the National Rifle Associationhave brought a new era of deregulation as the assault weapons ban expired, handgun bans were struck down by the Supreme Court and a raft of state legislatures passed controversial open carry and stand your ground laws. A simultaneous rise in the number and severity of mass shootingsVirginia Tech, Sandy Hook, Aurora and, most recently, Roseburg, Oregonhas become a rallying cry for new gun violence coalitions like Mayors Against Illegal Guns, largely underwritten by billionaire former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Similarly, the mayors strongly backed President Barack Obamas push for congressional action on gun control, believing that more gun regulation, rather than less, was the answer to the crime and shootings. They resoundingly opposed, by roughly a 9-1 margin, both open carry proposals and the idea of arming teachers or principals as a way to increase school security.
Washington inaction is one reason that more than 90 percent of the mayors surveyed said they believe cities and municipalities should be able to implement their own tougher gun restrictions than exist in their home states or by the federal government. They said that at the federal, state or local level, they overwhelmingly support a wide variety of gun control measuresinclude expanded/stricter background checks (90 percent); closing the so-called gun show loophole (86 percent); expanding gun-buying restrictions to prohibit people subject to restraining orders (78 percent); closing a federal loophole that allows gun sales to proceed unless the FBI background check is completed within three days (78 percent); renewing the federal assault weapons ban (80 percent); and stiffening penalties for straw purchases (73 percent).
Congress should act to protect the vast majority of residents by enacting sensible gun control measures, Long Beach, California, Mayor Robert Garcia said. There is no question that easy access to guns makes all of us less safe.
Just nine percent of the mayors surveyed said they supported no further gun control, with Tulsa, Oklahoma, Mayor Dewey Bartlett Jr. saying that he [honors] the Constitutional right of a U.S. citizen to bear arms.
More typical, though, were responses like that from Houston Mayor Annise Parker, who said she believes the Second Amendment clearly allows for some gun laws. As she put it, A well ordered militia surely means that reasonable controls on who can buy and/or own a gun are constitutional. Local officials are the ones best able to determine when and where concealed handguns should be carried.
Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said, Hawaii has the lowest rate of gun deaths in the entire nation, for one simple reason: We have strict gun laws. I strongly support the rights of law abiding citizens to own guns, but no one in Hawaii gets a gun license without a strict background check at the police department. We also benefit from the fact that its impossible to drive an illegal gun here from another state.
Absent a real commitment from Congresswhich mayor after mayor said was clearly lackingits no surprise that the residents of the nations cities were increasingly fearful of crime and shootings. As Dayton, Ohio, Mayor Nan Whaley said, This country is doing nothing and then elected congressmen have the audacity to seem surprised when we have a now near weekly devastation in our cities and unnecessary loss of life. We should not be surprised by this ending because our legislators choose to take no action.
Hartford, Connecticut, Mayor Pedro Segarra had an even simpler message for Congress: Get to work.

Joe Biden on SCOTUS: There is no 'Biden rule'
Washington (CNN) In his strongest and most passionate comments to date, Vice President Joe Biden called on Senate Republicans on Thursday to consider the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to fill the vacancy left by the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia and not "abdicate their responsibility."
He expressed concern about a "genuine constitutional crisis" that he said would be born out of the "dysfunction of Washington."
Biden warned about the perils of allowing important decisions to remain in "limbo" if an evenly divided court was unable to set a nationwide precedent in major cases. He said the effect of keeping a seat vacant for what could be hundreds of days could fracture the country.
"The framers designed our system to give one Supreme Court the responsibility of resolving conflicts in the lower courts," he said and added that if those conflicts are allowed to stand "we end up with a patchwork Constitution."
Biden reiterated the impact of the court's work on everyday Americans, on issues such as race discrimination, separation of church and state, abortion and police searches.
"Look at the cases," he said, adding, "the American people deserve a fully staffed Supreme Court of nine. "
"The longer this high court vacancy remains unfilled, the more serious the problem we will face -- a problem compounded by turbulence, confusion, and uncertainty about our safety and security, our liberty and privacy, the future of our children and grandchildren," Biden said.
And he noted he was fearful that the current gridlock in Congress would infect the high court.
"Dysfunction and partisanship are bad enough on Capitol Hill," he said. "We can't let the Senate spread that dysfunction to another branch of government -- to the Supreme Court of the United States. We must not let it fester."
In his remarks, Biden sought to push back at Republican critics who are using his comments from a 1992 floor speech as ammunition to argue that he too once stressed the need for delaying confirmation hearings until after the political campaign season was over.
At the time, Biden was discussing a hypothetical vacancy and said the president -- who was then George H.W. Bush -- should "not name a nominee until after the November election is completed." Supporters of Biden point to the fact that later in the same speech the then-Senate Judiciary Committee chairman pledged to consider a nominee "if the President consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selection absent consultation."
In Thursday's remarks Biden, who served in the Senate for 36 years and spent nearly half that time as chairman or ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said that during his tenure, every nominee got a committee hearing.
"There is no 'Biden rule.' It doesn't exist," he said.
Before the speech was delivered, a spokesman for Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, Don Stewart, dismissed the remarks as an attempt on the part of Biden to "clean up" past remarks that he had made by "claiming he didn't really say what he said."
McConnell has declined to meet with Garland although he called the judge the day his nomination was announced to wish him well and tell him personally that the Senate would not act.
On CNN's State of the Union McConnell said, "This nomination ought to be made by the president we're in the process of electing this year."
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley similarly said Biden's comments are a case of hypocrisy. In a statement the Iowa Republican said that Biden as chairman had failed to consider 44 judicial nominations.
"No matter how hard the White House tries to rewrite history, it can't change then Chairmen Biden's remarks explaining how the President and Senate should handle a Supreme Court nomination arising during a heated presidential campaign," Grassley said. "As Chairman Biden explained, the hyper-political environment is bad for the nominee, the court, and ultimately the nation."
Biden's comments about the dysfunction of Congress echoed what Chief Justice John Roberts said three years ago during a talk at the University of Nebraska. Speaking of the other two branches of government, Roberts said, "It's a period of real partisan rancor that I think impedes their ability to carry out their functions, and I don't want it to spill over and affect us."
More recently, in comments made before Scalia's death, Roberts was asked about the confirmation process during a talk at New England Law School in Boston. He said that he didn't think it was "functioning very well." He noted that when Justice Scalia and Ginsburg were confirmed the votes were unanimous or nearly so, but in recent years the votes for Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Samuel Alito have been closer to party lines.
"That doesn't make any sense," Roberts said. "That suggests to me that the process is being used for something other than ensuring the qualifications of the nominees."
The court has already released one 4-4 opinion in a case concerning the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. When the court is evenly divided, the lower court opinion is affirmed but no national precedent is set.
On Wednesday the court appeared to be closely divided in a much higher profile case concerning a challenge -- brought by non profit religiously affiliated groups -- to the Affordable Care Act's requirement that insurance plan provide a full range of contraceptive coverage. If it turns out that the court splits 4-4 in that case, the opinion could cause confusion across the country where lower courts are split on the issue. So far eight appellate courts have ruled in favor of the president, while one, the 8th Circuit, has ruled in favor of the challengers.
But conservative activists said the vice president's concerns about 4-4 decisions are misplaced, considering his actions in the Senate when roles were reversed.
"It was unfortunate and embarrassing to see Vice President Biden try to strike fear in Americans about how a temporarily divided 4-4 Court could threaten their freedom of speech and religion, particularly when Biden himself has stated that the costs of a divided Court are actually 'quite minor,'" said Brian Rogers, executive director of America Rising Squared.
Obama hails historic ratification of Paris climate agreement
President Obama hailed the fact Wednesday that enough nations have ratified the Parisclimate accord for it to enter into force, telling reporters gathered in the Rose Garden, Today is a historic day in thefight to protect our planet for future generations.
The European Parliament voted Tuesday by a wide margin to join the agreement, takingthe participation level past the threshold required for the treaty to take effect. Ratification by at least 55 countries representing 55 percent of global emissions was needed for the agreementto enter into force. Before the Tuesday vote, 62 nations accounting for 52 percent of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions had joined; seven members of the European Union have now individually ratified the accord, including Germany and France, which will ensure that it crosses the 55 percent threshold. There is a 30-day period before the agreement takes effect.
Today the world meets the moment, Obamasaid. And if we follow through on the commitments that this Paris agreement embodies, history may well judge it as a turning point for our planet.
The presidentsaid the United Stateshad played a pivotal role in brokering the agreement through both international diplomacy and the adoption of domestic regulations that have changed, fundamentally, the way that we consume energy.
One of the reasons I ran for this office was to make America a leader in this mission, he said.
[The Paris agreement is entering into force: Now comes the hard part]
Obamanoted that the voluntary targets that nearly 200 nations agreed to as part of last years deal will not be sufficient to keep global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), compared withpreindustrial levels: Even if we meet every target embodied in the agreement, we will only get to part of where we need to go. But he addedthat the agreement will avert some of the worst climate impacts and send a powerful signal that could open up the floodgates to new investment in renewable energy and other technologies that will cut the worlds carbon output.
So this gives us the best possible shot to save the one planet weve got, Obama said.
But Republicans, includingHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), said the voluntary carbon reductions the United States hasagreed to could lead to curbs on energy exploration that could punish poor Americansmuch more than the rich.
The Paris climate deal would be disastrous for the American economy. It carelessly throws away the great gains that the United States has made over the past decade in energy development, Ryansaid in a statement. The abundant, low-cost energy that we have unlocked will now be shut in the ground, eliminating the economic growth and jobs that come with development.
Obama appeared undaunted by such criticism. In the weeks ahead, he said, international negotiators are focused on finalizing new agreements that would impose limits on the airline industrys greenhouse gas emissions and onhydrofluorocarbons, which are used in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment, all of which will help build a world that is safer and more prosperous and more secure and more free than the one that was left for us.
Thats our most important mission, to make sure that our kids and our grandkids have at least as beautiful a planet, and hopefully even more beautiful, than the one that we have, Obamasaid. And today, Im a little more confident that we can get the job done.

Record Green Power Installations Beat Fossil Fuel for First Time
Renewable energy reached an important turning point last year with record new installations of emissions-free power surpassing sources that burn fossil fuel, according the International Energy Agency.
New installations of renewable energy overtook conventional power for the first time in 2015, the Paris-based agency said Tuesday in its Medium-Term Renewable Energy Market Report. Global green power rose by a record 153 gigawatts, equivalent to 55 percent of newly installed capacity last year. Total installed capacity exceeded coal for the first time, the IEA said.
We are witnessing a transformation of global power markets led by renewables and, as is the case with other fields, the center of gravity for renewable growth is moving to emerging markets, IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said.
The report shows the acceleration toward clean-power generation was already picking up pace before governments agreed in Paris in December to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Renewables will be the worlds fastest-growing source of electricity over the next five years, according to the report.
The IEA raised its estimate of the amount of green energy on power grids by 13 percent, revising its forecast to 42 percent by 2021. About 500,000 solar panels were installed each day across the globe in 2015, according to the report.
Renewables capacity will be supported by falling costs, according to the agency. Solar panels are projected to be a quarter cheaper over the five year forecast period ending in 2021. Onshore wind-turbine prices may drop 15 percent.
Much of the growth will be driven by four countries, the IEA said, identifying China, the U.S., India and Mexico as clean-energy hotspots over the next five years. Growth rates in the European Union, an early policy supporter and adopter of clean-energy technologies, may decline.

Tragic acts of gun violence continue to plague communities across the country, but last week, with several OFA volunteers in attendance, President Obama announced a series of common-sense executive actions that will help save lives.OFA organizers are on the front lines of the fight for gun violence preventionand they're continuing to push for a comprehensive solution to this problem. For those who attended the event at the White House, watching President Obama's announcement proved incredibly moving.Greg, a long-time organizer and a gun violence survivor, said the experience was "one of the most powerful days" of his life."Last week I got to sit in the White House amongst so many people who had survived gun-related tragedies, and watched President Obama doing literally everything in his power to help end gun violence," he said. "It was such an emotional feeling."The President's executive actions are a big step forward in making our communities safer, although a long-term solution can only come from Congress.Still, for organizers like OFA-Ohio state lead Martha, who was personally affected by a gun violence tragedy, the President's actions mark a crucial moment in the push for progress on this issue."The actions the President took today, I truly believe, will help other families, she told local press after her visit to the White House.Later in the week, Greg and Martha shared their own stories, speaking on OFA's call with President Obama. Both emphasized the continued need for strong action to prevent future gun violence tragedies.OFA-Portland chapter co-lead Judy, who also watched President Obama's announcement in person, echoed this point."To be there in the presence of so many survivor families who have ached for this day was to be lifted up and filled with renewed energy for the long campaign to change the hearts and votes of elected officials at all levels," she said. "The tears we all shed refreshed our commitment. President Obama gave the tipping point on gun sense a hard push, but it is up to all of us to keep the momentum going."The President's executive actions are critical steps in preventing gun violence, but Congress still needs to act to implement a comprehensive, long-term solution. And so far, they've done nothing to address this issuebut that can change.Every voice matters in this fight, especially when it comes to calling on Congress to do something about gun violence. So speak up and say you're ready for action.

It's a wrap: OFA's first annual Campus Organizing Summit
Earlier this month, 35 campus-based activists from all across the country came together at OFA headquarters in Chicago for the first-ever Campus Organizing Summit.The Campus Organizing Summit is part of a series of issue-focused trainings, which throughout this year have provided organizers with opportunities to expand their networks, problem solve challenges, and develop new skillswhile strengthening the pipeline of organizing talent in the progressive world.At the Campus Organizing Summit, participants kicked off the day by sharing their experiences and challenges back home, and exchanged ideas to help improve the impact of their work. In true OFA style, this training summit went beyond conversationstudents had to put their newly developed skills into action. In an innovative three-hour Lobby Games simulation, students had to apply what they had learned in order to effectively build issue advocacy campaigns. Their ultimate goal: to persuade key decision makers in their communities.Students worked with OFA training coaches to analyze a fictional failed campus issue campaign. Through these exercises, students learned the different pieces that make up a campaignand more importantly, they became familiar with the idea that organizing never happens in a vacuum. I had never really had one term to define all of the things surrounding organizing, said Anna from the University of Arizona, as she shared her experience learning about issue ecosystems.After learning to develop a campus issue campaign to persuade key decision makers, students put that plan into practice in order to implement their strategies, build coalitions, and lobby a fictional university's president and Board of Trustees.Destiny from the University of California at Berkeley said she learned that lobbying is a powerful tool for social change, and loved the opportunity to be able to practice it. Lauryn from Northwestern University shared that she "really enjoyed being around other people my age who are passionate about organizing as well."Here's what some of the other participants had to say:Although it's not always easy, it's important for organizers to use each other as valuable resources and to set aside the time to keep learning. These campus organizers came from all over the country to learn from one another, but you can join them in taking action, too.Get in touch with organizers from across the country by joining Connect, OFA's community organizing tool.

In a shock to no one, September was warmest such month on record
The planet's hot streak is crawling to a temporary end, but it's not over quite yet. September was the hottest such month on record, according to NASA, coming in at 0.91 degrees Celsius, or 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above average. This marks nearly a year straight of record heat, according to NASA, with 11 of the past 12 months ranking as the warmest on record.
September's record warmth assures that 2016 will be the warmest calendar year on record, taking over the top spot from 2015.
September only narrowly beat the previous warmest September, which occurred in 2014, making it a statistical tie, according to NASA.
According to a press release, September 2016's global average temperature was just 0.004 degrees Celsius, or 0.0072 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than September 2014.
September's temperature anomaly was considerably lower than that for other months in 2016, which blew away historical benchmarks. July of this year was not only the hottest July, but also the hottest month the planet has seen since instrument records began in 1880.
That milestone was tied in August, which beat the previous record for that month by 0.15 degrees Celsius, or 0.27 degrees Fahrenheit.
Of the 11 record warm months in NASA's database, seven had temperature anomalies that were at or greater than 1-degree Celsius, or 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit, above the 20th century average. Before this warm streak, this monthly threshold had never been crossed before.
To climate scientists, such a threshold is significant particularly because world leaders are seeking to limit global warming to at or below 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, below preindustrial levels through 2100.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which also keeps global temperature records, there have been 16 straight warmest months (September could become the 17th straight month of record warmth), which is unprecedented.
The September record virtually eliminates any doubt that 2016 will beat last year for the title of the warmest year on record.
The record warm streak was caused primarily by human-caused global warming, which is increasing global average temperatures over the long-term. In addition, a strong El Nio event helped heighten global average surface temperatures further.
We continue to stress that while monthly rankings are newsworthy, they are not nearly as important as long-term trends," NASA's Gavin Schmidt, who directs the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, said in a statement.
The monthly analysis comes from data gleaned from about 6,300 meteorological stations around the world, ship- and buoy-based instruments measuring sea surface temperature, and Antarctic research stations.
The reading for September is preliminary, with adjustments possible as more information comes in. For example, NASA announced Monday that the June temperature record had been revised downward to make it the third-warmest such month on record. Had this revision not been made, September would have marked a solid year straight of warmest months.
The extraordinarily warm year of 2016 has brought flood disasters to the U.S.  the most recent of which devastated parts of North Carolina  as well as in China.The flooding in North Carolina, which was the result of Hurricane Matthew combined with previous heavy rainfall earlier in the year, has broken all-time records in many locations in that state.
Typically hot locations, such as India, Kuwait and Iraq, set new benchmarks for what constitutes their hottest days.
Meanwhile, the world's oceans have been suffering through the longest-lasting global coral bleaching event on record, which is now expected to last into 2017.
Meanwhile in the Arctic, both the Northwest and Northeast Passages were open for navigation, with a massive cruise ship passing through the Northwest Passage for the first time, carrying more than 1,000 passengers and crew.
In addition, a small sailboat has nearly completed its circumnavigation of the Arctic, during which it passed through both the Northeast and Northwest Passage in a bid to raise awareness of climate change impacts. During much of its voyage the crew saw little to no sea ice.
Arctic sea ice hit the second-lowest level on record, which continues the long-term trend toward a seasonally ice-free Arctic.

Heres the Deal: The Text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership  The Trans-Pacific Partnership
When we have a level playing field, Americans out-compete anyone in the world. Thats a fundamental truth about our country.
But right now, the rules of global trade put our workers, our businesses, and our values at a disadvantage.
If youre an autoworker in Michigan, the cars you build face taxes as high as 70 percent in Vietnam. If youre a worker in Oregon, youre forced to compete against workers in other countries that set lower standards and pay lower wages just to cut their costs. If youre a small business owner in Ohio, you might face customs rules that are confusing, costly, and an unnecessary barrier to selling abroad.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership will change that.
Its the highest standard trade agreement in history. It eliminates 18,000 taxes that various countries put on American goods. That will boost Made-in-America exports abroad while supporting higher-paying jobs right here at home. And thats going to help our economy grow.
I know that past trade agreements havent always lived up to the hype. Thats what makes this trade agreement so different, and so important.
The TPP includes the strongest labor standards in history, from requiring a minimum wage and worker safety regulations to prohibiting child labor and forced labor. It also includes the strongest environmental commitments in history, requiring countries in one of the most biologically diverse areas on Earth to crack down on illegal wildlife trafficking, illegal logging, and illegal fishing. These standards are at the core of the agreement and are fully enforceablewhich means we can bring trade sanctions against countries that dont step up their game.
And for the first time ever, well have a multilateral trade agreement that reflects the reality of the digital economy by promoting a free and open Internet and by preventing unfair laws that restrict the free flow of data and information.
In other words, the TPP means that America will write the rules of the road in the 21st century. When it comes to Asia, one of the worlds fastest-growing regions, the rulebook is up for grabs. And if we dont pass this agreementif America doesnt write those rulesthen countries like China will. And that would only threaten American jobs and workers and undermine American leadership around the world.
Thats why I am posting the text of this agreement here for you to read and explore. Theres a lot in here, so weve put together summaries of each chapter to help you navigate whats in the agreement and what these new standards will mean for you.
I know that if you take a look at whats actually in the TPP, you will see that this is, in fact, a new type of trade deal that puts American workers first.

"Slow Jam the News" with President Obama
Happy 5th Birthday, West Wing Week!
Supreme Court struggles with just eight justices
WASHINGTON  Days after Justice Antonin Scalia's death in February, two of his eight remaining colleagues were asked how the Supreme Court would function without him.
"For the most part, it will not change," Justice Stephen Breyer said of the day-to-day workload.
Added Justice Samuel Alito, matter-of-factly: "We will deal with it."
If the past few weeksare any indication, however, change has come to the high court, and the justices are dealing with it in fits and starts.
Cases large and small are ending in tie votes. The pace of decisions has slowed slightly, and fewer new cases are being granted. Scalia's commanding presence at oral arguments hasn't been filled  nor, presumably, his role as the court's minence griseat privateconferences where decisions are made.
This week, apparently dissatisfied with all its options in a major case pitting religious freedom against reproductive rights, the court went so far as to suggest a solution that neither sidehad advocated. That's far afield from what Chief Justice John Roberts has called a judge's traditional role calling balls and strikes.
Perhaps the biggest change has been the simple subtraction of the court's senior justice, whose firm views on most matters of law gave his colleagues a viewpoint to rally around or rail against.
"None of them has ever been on the courtwithout Justice Scalia," says Erwin Chemerinsky, a Supreme Court scholar and founding dean of the University of California,Irvine School of Law.
The impact was on display throughout February and early March, when Scalia's place on the bench was left vacant anddraped with black cloth. It was noticeable later in March with a new, seniority-based seating arrangement, forcing Justice Sonia Sotomayor at one point to interruptan advocate at the lectern:"Counsel, I'm over here."
Suddenly, Justice Anthony Kennedy  for a decade the court's most likely swing vote  wasn't the onlyfocal point for lawyers in close cases. With five votes needed for a precedent-setting verdict, lawyers representing conservative causes need one of the four liberal justices as well.
Scalia's absence even appeared to affect the courtroom behavior of his closest friend there, Justice Clarence Thomas, who broke a 10-year silence Feb. 29 with a series of questions in a case affecting gun rights. True to form, Thomas quickly reverted to silence throughout March.
"Justice Scalia occupied a lot of space at oral argument," says Irv Gornstein, executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University Law Center. "Who is going to take up the questioning? In the most contentious cases, the pressure will be on the chief justice and Justice Alito."
With Senate Republicans vowing that they will not confirm a ninth justice until the nation has a 45th president, the court could remain a man down for a year or more.That's sure to weaken itsgrip on the nation's lower courts in cases where the justices can't break a tie.
The first sign of the times came last week, when thecourt deadlocked ina bankruptcy dispute between a Missouri bank and a development company that defaulted on its loans. It was a fairly minor case that drew little notice when it was argued on the first day of the term last October.
Then this week, one of the court's most important cases emerged in a tie, giving public employee unions a reprieve from what looked like a sure loss in a battle over the fees they collect from non-members. A likely 5-4 defeat for the California Teachers Associationbecame a deadlock, whichupheld the union's victory at the federal appeals court.
That one-sentence ruling  "The judgment is affirmed by an equally divided Court" was one of only two decisions handed down this week, a further indication that Scalia's death has slowed the process. So far, 13 cases have been decided in the court's February and March sittings, down slightly from an average of 18 in recent years.
More apparent has been the slower pace of new cases accepted for consideration  just two since Scalia died, compared to an average of about 12 during the same period in recent years. It takes the votes of four justices to heara case but five to win, which sometimes deters those inclined to hearit. The specter of tie votes rendering the process almost meaningless adds a new wrinkle.
"The fear of the end game is a different fear now," says Stephen Wermiel, a constitutional law professor at American University Washington College of Law.
That fear may have prompted the court's highly unusual order Tuesday. The justices asked for newbriefs from both sides in the challenge brought by religiously affiliated employers such as charities, hospitals and universities to the federal requirement that their employees receive free coverage of contraceptives.
The Obama administration's solution, rejected by the non-profits but upheld by most lower courts, called for them to write a letter or file a form transferring responsibility to insurers or third-party administrators. The justices asked if that could happen "without any such notice" from the employers  something akin to an immaculate conception.
"I cannot think of another example wherethe Supreme Court,in an order, suggested a compromise and then asked the parties to brief it, Chemerinsky said. "I had to read it three times to understand what it was saying."

Expanding health coverage in Tennessee
 Here in Tennessee, OFA volunteers are looking forward to bringing this film to nearby areas like Knoxville and Nashvilleso folks all over the state can learn more about RAM's work and find out how to get involved with this issue in their communities.
 Through Insure Tennessee, we have the chance to bring coverage to 280,000 residents who desperately need it. And, as of today, with 20 states still choosing not to expand Medicaid coverage, legislation like this is more important than ever. We must all work together to fight for access to quality health care to those who need it most.
 If you want to take action and push for health care reform in your area, get to know other organizers who are working on this issue in your community.

We must all work together to fight for access to quality health care to those who need it most.If you want to take action and push for health care reform in your area, get to know other organizers who are working on this issue in your community.
OFA fellows in Tennessee recently organized a screening of the award-winning documentary "Remote Area Medical," which follows a two-day pop-up medical and dental clinic at the Bristol Speedway.The initial goal of the clinic was to provide health services to people living in remote areas of third world countries. But today, much of the organization's work takes place in the United States, particularly in Appalachia.Wendell Potter, a former insurance public relations executive who now advocates for meaningful health care reform, and Stan Brock, who founded Remote Area Medical (RAM) in 1985, were both present for the screening. While Brock introduced the film, Potter spoke after its conclusion, and both stayed to take questions from the audience, which included advocates for Insure Tennessee. There are still 280,000 Tennesseans who fall into the coverage gap , unable to qualify for either Medicaid or federal subsidies for marketplace health insurance. Insure Tennessee aims to fill that gap.During his talk, Brock informed the group, "We reach a maximum at about 1,200 people a day, because everybody is getting real care and the doctors are spending a lot of time with each patient." He also pointed out that RAM has had more than 92,000 volunteers at their events to date. In Tennessee, OFA organizers are planning to work with local coalition partners to make sure Insure Tennessee passes, so the good folks at RAM can get back to helping those in developing countries as well.Potter told his powerful personal story of how he went from being an insurance executive to testifying before Congress, advocating for health care reform. He spoke about attending his first RAM event, saying, "When I saw those lines, I think my epiphany came when I realized some of those folks in line could have been people I went to school with, could have been my relativesit could have been me if my circumstances were different. That day I made a commitment to make a difference."He also emphasized the power of volunteers in action, urging everyone present at the screening to get involved in organizations that advocate for affordable health care for all citizens.Viewers left the screening fired up to make a difference in their own communities. Pam Weston, an OFA fellow, said that attending a RAM event is life-altering. "After seeing one of these events, you can no longer ignore the reality of our health care shortfalls with so many of our Tennessee citizens in the coverage gap. I can identify with Wendell Potter's story; I wish everyone could see this film."

2016 State of the Union
When President Obama took office, we were facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Seven years later, our businesses have created 14.1 million new jobs over the past 70 months.Weve rebuilt our manufacturing base, reformed our health care system, and reinvented our energy sector. Weve welcomed home more than 160,000 troops.
We are living through an extraordinary moment in human history. Technological and social change is reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our environment, and our place in the world.But as Americans, weve been through big changes before and, like generations past, we can make change work for us. In his speech, President Obama laid out his plan to seize opportunities before us.In looking forward, there are four big questions that we as a country have to answer.
How do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in the new economy?
How do we make technology work for us, and not against us, as we solve our biggest challenges?
How do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?
How can we make our politics reflect the best in us, and not the worst?
For all the challenges we face, the truth is that no country on Earth is better poised to seize the future than the United States.And if we answer these four basic questions, then there is nothing that America cant do.

It's the end of the fossil fuel era as we know it
Contrary to what the fossil fuel industry may want you to believe, the transformation of the world's energy supply to clean energy sources is well underway, according to a new report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF).
The"New Energy Outlook"report, released Monday, finds that at least $11.4 trillion will be invested in new power-generating capacity over the next 25 years, and 60 percent of that will fund wind and solar power.
According to thereport, we'll reach a tipping point in 2027, when new wind and solar power actually become cheaper than running existing coal and gas generators in much of the world. This will cause an acceleration in the deployment of clean energy technologies.
However, explosive emissions growth in India and Southeast Asia mean that the world is still not on the path necessary to limit global warming to the increases of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, that were targeted by the Paris Climate Agreement.
To meet that goal, an additional $5.3 trillion in new clean energy investment worldwide would be needed during the next 25 years.
Some $7.8 trillion will be invested globally in renewables between 2016 and 2040, two-thirds of the investment in all power generating capacity, but it would require trillions more to bring world emissions onto a track compatible with the United Nations... climate target," said Seb Henbest, the lead author of the report, in a press release.
Nevertheless, compared to other recent reports from BP and the DOE's Energy Information Administration, the BNEF report presents a far more optimistic outlook for the expanded use of zero or low-emissions technologies, from solar panels to electric vehicles.
The BNEF report contains several key predictions. When it comes to solar power, BNEF analysts think a reduction in the cost of developing, financing and operating new utility-scale solar installations will help drive costs lower. The projections foresee the spread of rooftop solar in Europe, Australia and the U.S., and soon in India and China as well.
By 2040, the BNEF report finds, Germany, Mexico, the UK and Australia will "all have average wind and solar penetration of more than 50 percent."
According to the report, an increase in solar and wind power generation will be accompanied by a decrease in coal and gas power plants over the next 25 years. But some coal plants will still be needed, particularly in developing countries like China and India.
What happens with global fossil fuel emissions  and therefore our ability to contain global warming to at or below 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels  will hinge on what happens in the Asia-Pacific region.
This is because energy demands in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to "experience colossal growth," the report found, with a tripling of installed new power generation capacity.
While solar and wind will make major gains, coal will still be this region's biggest source of electricity through 2040. This means that global power sector greenhouse gas emissions will not peak until after 2040.
The BNEF report is also bullish on the future for electric vehicles, projecting that they will make up 25 percent of the global car fleet by 2050, which would drive down battery and energy storage costs but increase electricity demand.

90 Times Senators On The Judiciary Committee Demanded A Vote On Judicial Nominees
Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has vowed not to hold committee hearings or vote for whomever President Obama nominates to the Supreme Court. But before the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia, Grassley, along with his fellow Republican committee members, have passionately insisted that senators have a constitutional obligation to advise and consent on a presidential nominee through an up-or-down vote.
Below, are 90 examples from Chairman Grassley, Sens. John Cornyn (R-TX), Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Jeff Sessions (R-AL).
U.S. Solar Surged 17% in 2015 Led by Demand for Rooftop Power
Solar power developers added a record 7.3 gigawatts of capacity in the U.S. last year, up 17 percent from 2014 and surpassing natural gas installations for the first time.
Residential installations climbed 66 percent, the fastest-growing segment, and accounted for 29 percent of all photovoltaic systems, according to a report Monday from GTM Research and the Washington-based Solar Energy Industries Association. California, North Carolina and Nevada were again the top three solar states. Utah jumped from 23rd to 7th, while New Jersey slipped to 10th from sixth.
The gains reflect the growing demand for clean energy sources as the U.S. and other nations seek to curb greenhouse gas emissions, as well as falling prices that make solar power more competitive with gas.
Total U.S. solar installations now exceed 25 gigawatts, equal to about one quarter of the countrys nuclear fleet, and up from just 2 gigawatts five years ago.
Rhone Resch, chief executive officer for the trade group, said a recent extension of tax credits for solar energy will help increase demand for at least the next few years.
Last year was a monumental year for us, Resch said in an interview. Whats most amazing is that were just getting started.
President Obama: We should be proud of what we've achieved
It's because of people like you who have stepped upin ways big and smallthat progress over the past few years has been possible. And as we roll into the final months of President Obama's last term in office, it's going to be up to folks like you to help make sure we aren't held back by those trying to stop progress.
The Majority of the New Energy Capacity Added to U.S. Grids Was Renewable
Renewable energy accounted for the majority of new power added to the U.S. power grids last yearmarking the second year in a row that clean energy surpassed fossil fuels, according to a new report from Bloomberg New Energy Finance and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy.
Renewable energy has enjoyed a boost from government incentives and declining systems costs.
Clean energy investments also rose 7.5% from the year before to $56 billion. Ten years earlier, in 2005, renewable investments barely amounted to more than $15 billion. More than half of last years amount went toward solar energy projects, while wind attracted $11.6 billion in investments.
Corporate procurement of clean energy contined to grow: It doubled from 2013 to 2014 and again from 2014 to 2015. Major corporate buyers included tech giants Google goog , Amazon amzn , Facebook fb , and Apple aapl .
Coal, meanwhile, emerged as the main loser of the year. As a record number of coal plants closed, domestic coal production continued its steady decline since 2008, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Big increase for US solar in 2016: Report
The U.S.'s solar power capacity continues to grow after more than two gigawatts (GW) of solar photovoltaic (PV) installations took place during the second quarter of 2016, according to a report released on Monday. 
The latest U.S. Solar Market Insight Report from GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) stated that the installations represented a 43 per cent increase compared to the second quarter of 2015.
"We're seeing the beginning of an unprecedented wave of growth that will occur throughout the remainder of 2016, specifically within the utility PV segment," Cory Honeyman, associate director of U.S. solar research at GTM Research, said in a news release.
Solar is becoming an increasingly important part of the world's renewable energy mix. In 2014 the International Energy Agency stated that the sun could be the planet's biggest source of electricity by 2050.
"With more than 10 gigawatts of utility PV currently under construction, the second half of this year and the first half of 2017 are on track to continue breaking records for solar capacity additions," Honeyman added.
The report found that utility scale installations represented 53 percent of all installed PV in the first half of 2016, with an extra 7.8 GW set to come online in 2016.
"Solar works in all 50 states and this report proves that what many would consider non-traditional markets are now firmly a part of the clean energy movement," Tom Kimbis, SEIA's interim president, said.
"While it took us 40 years to hit 1 million U.S. solar installations, we're expected to hit 2 million within the next two years," Kimbis added. "That record-breaking growth is made possible by solar's cost-competitiveness and the vast benefits it provides consumers, our nation's economy and environment."

Support global action on climate change
The Paris agreement is building global momentum to tackle climate change, but we can't stop now. Don't let deniers derail progress.
April breaks global temperature record, marking seven months of new highs
Last month was the hottest April on record globally  and the seventh month in a row to have broken global temperature records.
The latest figures smashed the previous record for April by the largest margin ever recorded.
It makes three months in a row that the monthly record has been broken by the largest margin ever, and seven months in a row that are at least 1C above the 1951-80 mean for that month. When the string of record-smashing months started in February, scientists began talking about a climate emergency.
Figures released by Nasa over the weekend show the global temperature of land and sea was 1.11C warmer in April than the average temperature for April during the period 1951-1980.
It all but assures that 2016 will be the hottest year on record, and probably by the largest margin ever.
The new record broke the previous one by 0.24C, which was set in 2010, at 0.87C above the baseline average for April. That record itself broke one set three years earlier at 0.75C above the baseline average for April.
The current blast of hot air around the globe is being spurred by a massive El Nio, which is a release of warm water across the Pacific Ocean. But its not the biggest El Nio on record and that spike in temperatures is occurring over a background of rapid global warming, pushing temperatures to all-time highs.
The interesting thing is the scale at which were breaking records, said Andy Pitman, director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science at the University of New South Wales in Australia. Its clearly all heading in the wrong direction.
Climate scientists have been warning about this since at least the 1980s. And its been bloody obvious since the 2000s. So wheres the surprise? said Pitman.
Pitmans said the recent figures put the recent goal agreed in Paris of just 1.5C warming in doubt. The 1.5C target, its wishful thinking. I dont know if youd get 1.5C if you stopped emissions today. Theres inertia in the system. Its putting intense pressure on 2C, he said.
The record temperatures were wreaking havoc with ecosystems around the world. Theyve triggered the third recorded global coral bleaching, and in Australia 93% of the reefs have been affected by bleaching along the 2,300km Great Barrier Reef. In the northern parts of the reef, its expected the majority of coral is dead, and on some reefs over 90% of the coral is dying.
A recent analysis showed the bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef was made 175 times more likely because of climate change, and the conditions that caused it would be average in fewer than 20 years.
The April figures come as the symbolic milestone of CO2 concentrations of 400 parts per million (ppm) have been broken at the important Cape Grim measuring station in Tasmania, Australia.
Reflecting on the CO2 concentrations, Pitman said: The thing thats causing that warming, is going up and up and up. So the cool ocean temperatures we will get with a La Nia are warmer than wed ever seen more than a few decades ago  This is a full-scale punching of the reef system on an ongoing basis with some occasionally really nasty kicks and it isnt going to recover.

Obama has done more to save energy than any other president
Its an understatement to say that the Obama administration has been dedicated to fighting climate change  with its biggest achievements including introducing the Environmental Protection AgencysClean Power Plan and negotiating the Paris climate agreement. This is surely the most that any U.S. president has done to try to change the course of energy heating the planet.
But its much less widely known that at the same time, Obama could also be dubbed the energy efficiency presidenttheU.S. leader who has done more than any other to help us use less energy, and pay less for it, as we go about our daily lives. Which, of course, also helps fight climate change.
The story does not command nearly as much attention as the Paris talks or the Clean Power Plan, but the facts are toughto dispute: Obamas Energy Department has finalized more new standards for energy efficient appliances and products than any past administration, anew reportfinds.
TheEnergy Department has alsobeen toutingits major progress in this area,but the new report, by two outside expert groups monitoring this space, theAppliance Standards Awareness Project and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, validates the claim.
If you compare that to what prior administrations have completed, its far and away the most any president has been able to achieve through the administrative process, says Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project and the reports lead author.
The net consequence of the work has been to push improvements to45 separate types of energy-consuming products so far  ranging from refrigerators to light bulbs.
The findings are no surprise to industry groups, which have not always been happy with the results.While corporate groups have participated in theseregulatory processes and praised some of them, the overall effect has been burdensome,according toStephen Yurek, president and chief executiveof theAir-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute.
There are very real consequences from this rush to regulate, Yurek said in a statement. Yes, complying with these rules costs my member companies millions and millions of dollars, but what is far more important is that American jobs are being lost and consumers, who are already feeling financial squeezed, are being forced to pay more for products they rely on in their everyday lives, from comfort cooling and heating to refrigeration to hot water.
Of all of these regulations, the most enormous, in terms of energy consequences, is a rule governing large scale, commercial air conditioners, heat pumps, and furnaces, which heat and cool enormous buildings. This regulation, alone, is projectedto cut close to a billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The Energy Department has called it thelargest energy-saving standard in history  another way in which Obamas administration has stood out from prior ones in this sphere.
[Obama just released the biggest energy efficiency rule in U.S. history]
Overall, the administrations regulations are set tosave Americans an estimated $ 540 billion in electric and other bill expenditures through the year 2030. Naturally, these changes also are projected to cut greenhouse gas emissions  by about 210 million tons annually fortheperiod.
The study finds the closest runner up to the Obama administrations activism is George W. Bush, who was at the helm for 27 energy-saving initiatives. But 23 of those were achieved by signing energy bills into law, rather than by usingadministrative action. Moreover, deLaski says, the Obama administration could still complete about 10 more standards before leaving office.
Theyve been working at a pace of about 10 new standards per year, he says.
Taking into account standards enacted by law and those set by DOE, the Obama administration has completed 18 more standards than any prior administration, the report finds. Accounting only for standards set by DOE rulemaking, the Obama administration has completed seven times more standards than any previous administration.
Much of the rulemaking is part of a program thatdates back to the 1987National Appliance Energy Conservation Act, since expanded by further legislation in 1992, 2005, and 2007. The resultis that over 55 different types of energy consuming products sold in the U.S. are covered by a program that sets initial energy efficiency requirements, and then, in general, calls for re-evaluating those standards every six years, improving them as necessary.
When it came to setting mandatory appliance standards, past administrations had fallen behind  leaving the incoming Obama administration with a great deal of work to do. The administration not only caught up on past missed deadlines, explains deLaski, but then stayed on schedule, meaning that over the total eight years of Obamas term, it is more or less set to review and possibly update standards for most covered products.
By the time Obama took office, [the Department of Energy] had missed 22 legal deadlines for updating standards, said deLaski. So all those missed deadlines have been caught up during the Obama administration, and then they also have met new deadlines established in the 2007 and 2005 energy laws.
Indeed, when the president announced his climate action plan in 2013, one key component was cutting 3 billion total tons of carbon dioxide pollution by the year 2030 through new energy efficiency standards.
The overall effect of improved U.S. energy efficiency over the past several decades has in fact been so great that it appears to be contributing to a major trend in the utility sphere  flat levels of electricity demand. If you take all the improvements that have been set in motion since around 1990, arecent reportby the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy found, then were using 12 percent less electricity than we would be otherwise, as of 2014.
Most people, opening fridges and turning on light switches and setting thermostats likely are not aware of how those efficiency gains came about.
Its a pretty quiet policy, in terms of people understanding that its out there, affecting products, says deLaski.
Its pretty clear the Obama administration will keep on going with energy efficiency improvements through January of next year  but the question then becomes whether the next administration will continue to build on these gains.
If it does, the new report estimates that another 200 million tons per year of carbon dioxide emissions could be avoided per year by 2050  and $ 65 billion in annual expenditures on electricity bills.
Climate change has been making western forest fires worse for decades, study says
Many scientists have predicted that climate change could cause wildfires to increase in the future. Anda new study, just out on Monday, demonstratesjust how much its already been making them worse.
The paper, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests the effects of climate change have been helping make forests in the western United States in states including New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana and everything else to the west  drier and easier to burn since the 1970s. And in the last three decades, the study finds climate change played a role in nearly doubling the area hit by forest fires since 1984.
A primary way climate influences fire seasons is by causing the local vegetation to dry out, through changes in temperature, precipitation or other factors. Previous studies have suggested theres an incredibly strong and reliable relationship between the dryness of the climate and the area hit by forest fires, said Park Williams, one of the studys authors and a climate expert at Columbia University.
So he and lead study author John Abatzoglou of the University of Idaho decided to focus on how both dryness and total fire area have increased over the last few decades  and how much human-caused climate change, as opposed to just natural climate variations, has had to do with it.
The researchers examined eight different systems of measurement scientists commonly use to calculate the dryness of fuel in fire areas. Each one suggested that there have been significant increases in dryness between 1979 and 2015. The researchers also found there was a strong relationship between the increasing dryness and the area of land affected by forest fires. Overall, dryness accounted for more than three-quarters of the changes in burned area over the last three decades.
That allows us to basically say that climate has been the predominant driver of area burned in these western forests, Abatzoglou said.
The researchers then applied a climate model to investigate how big a hand human-causedclimate change has had in these changes, comparing what the fires look like when climate change is factored in versus what they look like when the effects of suchclimate changes are excluded.
Overall, the researchers found that anthropogenic climate change was responsible for just over half of the total observed increase in fuel dryness since 1979. In turn, this influence has added more than 16,000 square miles of forest fire area to the western United States since 1984  an area larger than the state of Maryland  nearly doubling the area scientists might have expected without the influence of similarclimate change.
The other half of these observed changes can be attributed to natural climate variations, the researchers say. For example, the past few decades have seen significant declines in spring precipitation out west  a change that scientists have partly attributed to a shift in a natural, large-scale ocean-atmosphere pattern known as the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, which can cause long-term changes in ocean temperatures and global weather patterns.
Its this sort of compounding effect of natural climate variability aligning with climate change that has likely brought about this pretty significant increase weve seen in forest fire activity, Abatzoglou said.
That said, there are plenty of other factors that can affect the severity of fires besides just climate and dryness, even if these are likely the most dominant drivers. The abundance of vegetation in an area makes an obvious difference, Williams noted, as do events like lightning strikes and even some human fire management practices. Fire suppression tactics, for instance  preventing or snuffing out fires as much as possible  can lead to an overabundance of dry vegetation in some areas, increasing the likelihood of larger, more severe fires in the future.
But the big message is that climate is one of the biggest drivers of the recent increases in forest fires. And the effects are growing bigger and bigger over time, Williams noted.
The fact is that this relationship between fuel aridity and forest fire area is exponential, he said.That means that every degree of warming has a bigger impact on forest fire area than the previous degree of warming. That explains to me why every year we hear career-long firefighters saying theyve never seen fires burning the way that theyre burning.
And in the next few decades, the researchers believe we may see even bigger and more severe fires as the effects of climate change continue to grow.
Going forward in the next three to four decadesI expect fires to continue to become unrecognizable to previous generations, Williams said. In the 2030s, it is a very high likelihood that fires [will be] dwarfing the fires that we see today.
Past a certain point, its possible that so much burning will have taken place that there wont be enough fuel to continue feeding the flames, and so the fires will naturally begin to shrink down again, he added. But for decades at least, its likely that forest fires will continue to grow.
And thats a reality that communities in the western U.S. should start to prepare for, the researchers note. This includes setting up fire breaks around town, planning escape routes and investing in public education about healthy fire management techniques, like controlled burning.
One thing we all need to do is just get used to the idea that there are going to be continued increases in forest fire area, Williams said. And that means that towns that are situated in locations surrounded by forest need to make sure they are expecting a big fire to come through. A policy of hope is a really unwise one.
Live Updates: What the President is Doing to Keep Guns Out of the Wrong Hands
The Final State of the Union
Justice delayed: Our view
Gamesmanship on nominees extends well beyond the Supreme Court.
TheRepublican-led Senate sure knows how to make history, but not in a good way. By leaving town Sept. 28 without acting on the nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, it has left a nominee hanging for an unprecedented six-and-a-half-months without so much as a hearing and left the Supreme Court limping along one justice short and vulnerable to more tie votes.
The foot-dragging extends well beyond the Supreme Court to the rest of the federal judiciary, where more than 50other Obama nominees await hearings orconfirmation votes.
Depending on who wins the presidency and a Senate majority Nov. 8, the high court could be shorthanded through early2017 andperhaps much longer. When the court splits 4-4as it did in four cases last term the lower court ruling stands. Its as if the Supreme Court never took the case at all.
In June, for example, the court deadlocked 4-4 on President Obamas plan to prevent the deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants. That split left in place an appeals court decision striking down the plan in essence a national decision made by a regional court that does not represent the whole country.
Similar outcomes are possible this term, which opened Monday. While the Supreme Courthas not taken any blockbuster cases, it will hear disputesinvolving far-reaching issues, includingseparation of church and state, racial discrimination by a jury,insider trading and the death penalty.
Even before Garland was nominated last March, GOPsenators made clear that no Obama Supreme Court nominee, no matter how well qualified, would get a vote or even aconfirmation hearing, as Republicans ran out the clock, hoping to win the White House and the right to pick the next justice.
Obamas choice of the highly regarded Garland, 63, who heads the powerful D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and is well within the broad judicial mainstream, did not change their minds. However, their mantrathat the pick belongs to the voters who choose the next president is wearing thin. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., recently told theThe Daily Beast:"Nobody really believes that, because if this were the last year of a Republican presidency, nobody would say that.
Gamesmanship over judicial nominees is not new. As courts have become moreideological, both Democrats and Republicans play stalling games when the opposite party controls the White House. But Republicans have extended the typical battles over nominees to the Supreme Court and influential appeals courts down to the trial courts.
While these lower courts get lessattention than the Supreme Court,they are the places where most people come in contact with the federal court system. Trial courts hearthousands of cases involving ordinary Americans: Entrepreneurs in contract disputes. Consumers targeted for fraud. Individuals arguing theyve faced discrimination in seeking housing or a job.
Yet the Senate adjourned withmore than 90 judgeships vacantmore than10% of the federal judiciary.
Thats the largest number since 1992,the final year of George H.W. Bushs term when the Democrat-controlled Senate left more than 100. Stallingwas no more acceptable thenthan it is now. But atleast during the previous two years, the Senate had confirmed122Bush nominees. In the past two years, this Senate has confirmed just 22 of Obamas nominees.
When many seats on the bench are empty andcaseloads are heavy, justice is delayed. One seat on the North Carolina trial court has been empty for 11 years.
The problem is simple:Senate Republicans areshirking their constitutional responsibility to advise and consent on judicial nominations. Americans deserve enough federaljudges to hear their disputesand a Supreme Court with a full complement of nine justices to rule on national issues.

The Nation He Built
On March 23, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the 906-page health care reform law known as Obamacare. It was, as a live microphone caught Vice President Joe Biden exclaiming to his boss, a big deal, with Biden memorably inserting an extra word for emphasisand for historybetween big and deal.
Obamacare would cover millions of the uninsured, a giant step toward the Democratic dream of health care for all. It also included dozens of less prominent provisions to rein in the soaring cost and transform the dysfunctional delivery of American medicine. It was the kind of BFD that the most consequential presidencies are made of, even though it had squeaked through Congress without any Republican votes, and few Americans truly understood what was in it.
Even fewer Americans understood what was in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, the 55-page addendum that officially finalized Obamacare. This was the strange legislative vehicle that Democrats had jerry-rigged to drag reform around a Republican filibuster. Its substance was mostly an afterthoughtthe New York Times ran a dutiful story on page A16 after it passedbut as Obama noted when he signed it the next week at Northern Virginia Community College, it included another BFD.
Whats gotten overlooked amid all the hoopla, all the drama of last week, is whats happened in education, he said.
Yes, education. Tucked into the parliamentary maneuver that rescued his health care law was a similarly radical reform of the trillion-dollar student loan program. When Bidens wife, Jill, a professor at Northern Virginia, introduced Obama that day, she called it another historic piece of legislation. The House Republican leader, John Boehner of Ohio, complained that today, the president will sign not one, but two job-killing government takeovers.
Obamacare wasnt really a government takeover, but the student loan overhaul actually was; it yanked the program away from Sallie Mae and other private lenders that had raked in enormous fees without taking much risk. The bill then diverted the budget savings into a $36 billion expansion of Pell Grants for low-income undergraduates, plus an unheralded but extraordinary student-debt relief effort that is now quietly transferring the burden of college loans from struggling borrowers to taxpayers. It all added up to a revolution in how America finances higher education, completely overshadowed by the health care hoopla and drama.
Over the past seven years, Americans have heard an awful lot about Barack Obama and his presidency, but the actual substance of his domestic policies and their impact on the country remain poorly understood. He has engineered quite a few quiet revolutionsand some of his louder revolutions are shaking up the status quo in quiet ways. Obama is often dinged for failing to deliver on the hope-and-change rhetoric that inspired so many voters during his ascent to the presidency. But a review of his record shows that the Obama era has produced much more sweeping change than most of his supporters or detractors realize.
Its true that Obama failed to create the post-partisan political change he originally promised during his yes-we-can pursuit of the White House. Washington remains as hyperpartisan and broken as ever. But he also promised dramatic policy change, vowing to reinvent Americas approach to issues like health care, education, energy, climate and finance, and that promise he has kept. When you add up all the legislation from his frenetic first two years, when Democrats controlled Congress, and all the methodical executive actions from the past five years, after Republicans blocked his legislative path, this has been a BFD of a presidency, a profound course correction engineered by relentless government activism. As a candidate, Obama was often dismissed as a talker, a silver-tongued political savant with no real record of achievement. But ever since he took office during a raging economic crisis, hes turned out to be much more of a doer, an action-oriented policy grind who has often failed to communicate what hes done.
What hes done is changing the way we produce and consume energy, the way doctors and hospitals treat us, the academic standards in our schools and the long-term fiscal trajectory of the nation. Gays can now serve openly in the military, insurers can no longer deny coverage because of pre-existing conditions, credit card companies can no longer impose hidden fees and markets no longer believe the biggest banks are too big to fail. Solar energy installations are up nearly 2,000 percent, and carbon emissions have dropped even though the economy is growing. Even Republicans like Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who hope to succeed Obama and undo his achievements, have been complaining on the campaign trail that hes accomplished most of his agenda.
The change is real, says Ron Klain, who served as Bidens White House chief of staff, and later as Obamas Ebola czar. It would be nice if more people understood the change.
In a conflict-obsessed media environment that is not exactly geared toward substantive policy analysis, Obamas technocratic brand of change has tended to be more opaque than, say, Donald Trumps plan for a wall along the Mexican border or Bernie Sanders promise of free college for all. At times, its complexity has camouflaged its ambition. At other times, its ambition hasnt lived up to Obamas rhetoric; not everything has changed in the Obama era. For example, he talked a big game about eliminating wasteful programs, but other than killing the F-22 fighter jet, an absurdly expensive presidential helicopter and a hopelessly captured bank regulatory agency called the Office of Thrift Supervision, he hasnt done much of that.
The most obvious thing Obama hasnt done is usher in a new era of public enthusiasm for government action and the Democratic Party. He was reelected by a comfortable margin, but conservative Republicans have taken back both houses of Congress and made impressive gains in statehouses on his watch, riding a powerful wave of hostility to federal overreach. That political legacy could imperil some of Obamas left-of-center policy legacy if a Republican is elected to succeed him. It has already stymied gun control and immigration reform, while forcing Obama to accept deep spending cuts he didnt want.
But its remarkable how often Obama has gotten what he wanted, in many cases policies that Democrats (and sometimes moderate Republicans) have wanted for decades, and how often those policies have slipped under the radar.
Montana Becomes The 30th Medicaid Expansion State
"This agreement will bring much needed access to health care coverage to more than 70,000 low-income Montanans, said Health and Human Service Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in a statement. The administration looks forward to working with other states to expand Medicaid by designing programs that meet states needs while providing needed services to residents and significant economic benefits to states.
According to the AP, an estimated 45,700 people would actually participate in the expanded program, as predicted by legislative analysts.
Expanding Medicaid had been an uphill battle in the conservative Big Sky state. At one point, Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock (pictured above) and GOP state legislators had to resort to secret meetings to iron out a deal. After passing the expansion legislation -- known as the HELP Act -- earlier this year, Montana requested two waivers seeking exemptions from the federal government's Medicaid expansion requirements.
The announcement of Montana's approval comes as the federal government kicks off this year's open enrollment period for the 2016 coverage year.

US wind energy output hit record in '15, industry group says
BRIGHTON, Colo. (AP)  Wind energy generated a record 191 megawatt-hours of electricity last year, enough for 17.5 million homes, an industry group said Tuesday.
The American Wind Energy Association said wind produced 4.7 percent of the nation's electricity in 2015. Coal generated 33 percent and natural gas slightly less than that, the association said.
The association released the statistics at a Vestas Wind Systems turbine plant in Brighton, Colorado, near Denver.
Demand for wind energy is also driving up employment. The industry employed the equivalent of 88,000 full-time workers last year, up 20 percent in a year, the report said.
"We need wind technicians to keep these machines running smoothly," Tom Kiernan, CEO of the association, said at a news conference.
Chris Brown, president of Vestas America, said it can be difficult to find qualified workers.
Starting pay for wind technicians is about $25 an hour, said Auston Van Slyke, wind energy technology director for Ecotech Institute in Aurora, a private school that trains workers for the renewable energy industry.
Texas remains No. 1 for wind energy while Iowa is second. Iowa generated more than 30 percent of its electricity from wind last year, a record for any state, the report said.
The group said tax breaks extended by Congress last year will help stabilize the industry.
Xcel Energy announced Tuesday it plans to build Colorado's largest wind farm in the eastern part of the state, with enough turbines to generate 600 megawatts of electricity.
David Eves, president of Xcel's Colorado operation, said the wind farm would occupy land in several counties but declined to say which ones. He also declined to say how much it would cost.
He said more details would come in May.

The Senate Republicans, Merrick Garland and the Lessons of History | Huffington Post
On February 13, the very day of Justice Antonin Scalia's untimely death, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell stunningly announced that the Senate, under Republican control, would not consider any nominee President Barack Obama put forth to succeed Justice Scalia. McConnell and his fellow Senate Republicans insisted that the American people should have the opportunity to weigh-in on this issue, and that it was therefore President Obama's successor, rather than President Obama, who should have the authority to replace Justice Scalia.
Despite that unprecedented proclamation, on March 16 President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to succeed Justice Scalia. Although everyone with even a modicum of expertise agrees that Chief Judge Garland is a highly-qualified, highly-respected, and moderate nominee, Senate Republicans have adamantly refused even to consider his nomination.
The purported "justification" for the Senate Republicans' refusal to even consider Merrick Garland's nomination is that the next president should be the one given the authority to appoint Justice Scalia's successor. By employing this strategy, Senate Republicans, praying for a victory in November, hope to enable Donald Trump, rather than Barack Obama, to appoint the next Justice of the Supreme Court.
In a new scholarly article, law professors Robin Kar and Jason Mazzone have taken a deep dive into the history of Supreme Court nominations to test the plausibility of the Senate Republicans' purported "justification" for their action. Not surprisingly, they find that the Senate Republicans' alleged "justification" is completely bogus. It is, in short, exactly what it appears to be -- a cynical and unconscionable sham.
What Kar and Mazzone found is that over the entire course of American history there have been 103 instances (prior to this one) in which an elected president faced a vacancy on the Supreme Court prior to the election of the next president. They found that in every one of those 103 instances, the president nominated and, with the advice and consent of the Senate, appointed the new Justice. There has not been a single exception to this practice in all of American history. And this is true even when, as in the current situation, the vacancy arose during an election year. In short, this would be the first time in American history that a president in President Obama's position would be denied the opportunity to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court.
As Kar and Mazzone note, there have been six instances, all in the nineteenth century, in which a sitting president failed to secure the confirmation of a nominee before his term ended. But those six cases were clearly distinguishable from the current situation.
In three of those cases -- all of which occurred more than 150 years ago - the nomination was made by a president who had not been elected president. They all involved situations in which a vice-president had assumed the presidency after the death of the president. At that time, early in our nation's history, it was assumed that unelected presidents did not enjoy the full powers and authority of elected presidents.
In the three other cases, all of which also occurred in the 19th century, the nomination of a new Supreme Court Justice was made after the election of the president's successor. In those situations, it was thought reasonable to permit the already elected successor to make the nomination.
The bottom line, then, is this: In 225 years of American history, the only times a sitting president has not succeeded in filling a Supreme Court vacancy involved highly unusual circumstances not in any way implicated in the current situation. More to the point, in every one of the 103 instances that mirror the current state of affairs, the president has been able to appoint a Justice to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court -- without a single exception.
What this clearly demonstrates is that the rationale the Senate Republicans have cynically put forth to "justify" their behavior is in direct defiance of 225 years of American history. The plain and simple fact is that there is no constitutionally legitimate justification for the Senate Republicans' position. It is unprincipled, unprecedented, and, as Kar and Mazzone observe, dangerously destructive to a well-settled Supreme Court confirmation process that has served our nation well from the very founding of the Republic.
Moreover, as Kar and Mazzone warn, such an unprincipled departure from the settled constitutional process will seriously undermine the fundamental "norms of cooperation" that have enabled the Supreme Court appointments process to function reasonably smoothly throughout our nation's history.
The precedent set by this behavior, they conclude, will inevitably lead to a more "politicized appointment process and, ultimately, to a more politicized Court." Having opened the door to such abuse of the confirmation process, the Senate Republicans have now invited similar abuse in the future. None of this bodes well for our nation. It is, truly, unconscionable.

July was absolutely Earths hottest month ever recorded
NOAA and NASA data reveal the Earths temperature reached its highest point in 136 years of record-keeping during July.
July 2016 was absolutely the hottest month since the instrumental records began, tweeted Gavin Schmidt, who directs NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which is responsible for temperature measurements.
It was the 15th straight month of recording-breaking temperatures in NOAAs analysis and 10th-straight in NASAs, passing the previous hottest Julys by substantial margins.
Its a little alarming to me that were going through these records like nothing this year, said Jason Furtado, a professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.
Each month just gives another data point that makes the evidence stronger that were changing the climate, added Simon Donner, professor of climatology at the University of British Columbia.
July is usually the hottest month of the year, as it coincides with the peak of summer in the Northern Hemisphere. But this July was more than 1.5 degrees above average in both NOAA and NASAs analyses.
July 2016 was the 379th consecutive month with temperatures at least nominally above the 20th century average, NOAA said.
Most of the planets land and ocean areas were warmer than normal in July. Parts of the Arctic were more than 7 degrees (4 Celsius) above average.
Warmer- to much-warmer-than-average temperatures were observed across much of all land masses, with record warmth observed mainly across parts of Indonesia, southern Asia, and New Zealand, NOAA said.
Blistering heat scorchedthe Middle East. Mitribah, Kuwait, simmered to 129.2 degrees which, if confirmed, would mark the hottest temperature ever recorded in the Eastern Hemisphere.
[Two Middle East locations hit 129 degrees, hottest ever in Eastern Hemisphere]
Furtado said the record global warmth was connected to extreme weather events happening around the world, such as the urban flooding in Ellicott City, Maryland, and record flooding in China. The two are going hand-in-hand, and theyre giving us a picture of what a future world might look like, he said.
An independent analysis of the global temperature from the Japan Meteorological Agency corroborated Julys record warmth:
The planets temperature has steadily risen in recent decades as heat-trapping gases have accumulated in the atmosphere. But temperatures have recently spiked, setting record highs two years in a row, in 2014 and 2015. One of the strongest El Nio events on record, dispersing heat from the Pacific Ocean into the atmosphere, has given temperatures an extra boost.
The El Nio event ended this spring, and the planets temperature difference from normal is no longer as remarkably high as it was earlier in the year. But it still remains at record highs.
Theres been so much talk about El Nio this year, but this [warming] is not just El Nio, said Donner. The records set in 2016 have crushed the records set in previous El Nios.
NASAs Schmidt said there is a 99 percent chance 2016 will become the hottest year on record, passing 2015 and 2014.
The Earths average temperature year-to-date ranks as the warmest on record by a hefty margin of 0.34 degrees (above 2015, the next warmest year), NOAA said.
Obamas National Monuments Have Been An Economic Boon For Local Economies
The national monuments that President Obama has created or expanded are generating more than $156 million in local economic activity annually, according to a study published Wednesday.
The report, which was conducted by Colorado-based BBC Research and Consulting on behalf of an organization representing small businesses, looked at the economic activity of out-of-town visitors traveling at least 60 miles to their destinations. It found that the impact to the local workforce of such non-local visitor spending is equivalent to supporting 1,820 jobs.
Too often, we only view land as valuable when it is being developed, mined, drilled or logged, U.S. Senator Harry Reid (D-NV) said in a statement. But, as this report shows, we can protect the most magnificent areas of our nation while also providing real opportunities for local economies.
The analysis focused on 10 of the 22 monuments that President Obama has designated since taking office. These 10 include only monuments that protect natural or cultural resourcessuch as the San Gabriel Mountains in California or Basin and Range in Nevada, and dont include monuments protecting historic resources.
The estimated economic benefits are likely to grow in the coming years because newly designated historical monuments are in the process of expanding visitor hours, and national monuments created to protect natural and cultural resources tend to grow in popularity after designation. And Obamas monuments are already popular: between 2011 and 2015, according to the report, these monuments saw about 3.9 million visitors each year.
President Obama is the sixteenth president (including eight Republicans and seven other Democrats) to use the Antiquities Act of 1906 to designate national monuments. His designations have preserved more acres of land and ocean from development than any of his predecessors. Wednesdays report highlights how the presidential use of the Antiquities Act is not only a catalyst for conserving public lands, but also an economic driver.
Protecting our nations natural assets is a smart move that boosts tourism dollars in these often rural areas, providing increased economic opportunities for entrepreneurs and their communities, Rhett Buttle, president and managing director for Small Business Majority, said in a statement.
The sums reported Wednesday represent only a fraction of the economic boost communities near conserved public landsincluding monuments, parks, and national forestsenjoy. Currently, the federal government does not track the comprehensive contributions of the outdoor industry to the U.S. economy, despite requests from the industry to do so. The Outdoor Industry Association estimates that overall outdoor recreation in the U.S. generates upwards of $646 billion in consumer spending annually and 6.1 million jobs.

Chief Judge Merrick Garland: The Public Servant  The White House
Few people are better positioned to speak about Judge Garlands commitment to the rule of law and his dedication to advancing equal justice under the law more than the clerks that have worked for him over the years.
See what he had to say about it in the official questionnaire he sent up to the Senate this week:
For him, pro bono service is a fundamental part of the legal professiona lesson he imparted to all those he worked with.
Throughout his career, Chief Judge Garland has dedicated his time and legal expertise to helping others who could not afford the representation they deserve under the law. As he said earlier this year:
The kids are always a little bit in awe of the person their parents refer to simply as the Judge. In fact, I can remember one year as we were on our way to the brunch, my young son asked nervously if the Judge would be wearing a white wig and carrying a gavel. But Judge Garland quickly puts the kids at ease, getting right down on the floor to play with them and even putting together a scavenger hunt for them in the backyard.
Jessica Ring Amunson: I love to watch Judge Garland at the brunch that he and his family host every year at their home for the Judges clerks and grandclerks (the children of his clerks).
Several of them took some time to reflect on who Merrick Garland is as a federal judge and how his dedication to public service has shaped their own lives as lawyers. Heres what clerks Eric Berger, Kendall Turner, Josh Segal, Previn Warren, and Jessica Ring Amunson have to say about their former boss:
Previn Warren: Whenever the Judges daughters calledno matter what he was in the middle of doinghe would pick up the phone and talk to them. He could be in the middle of a complex, arcane, dense analysis of the most intricate legal issuesif Becky or Jessie called, the Judge could switch gears immediately and be Chief Dad, ready to talk about college or career decisions, boys, Rihanna, whatever.
People have commented endlessly about the Judges brilliance, his fairness, and his long history of accomplishments, but most people dont realize that he has been able to balance all that while being an incredibly warm and caring father. I started my clerkship just a month after my first son was born and I was always struck by the Judges ability to so expertly balance his work and family life. That is a rare quality in someone of his stature and its representative of who he is as a person, not just a jurist.
Josh Segal: Id been working closely with Judge Garland on an opinion that had gone through a number of drafts, and we were nearing the finish line.
We talked through potential ways of handling one particularly difficult legal issue, and the Judge stopped and asked: Are we coming out the right way on this one?
To me, that interaction conveyed a remarkable willingness on the Judges part to question his own prior conclusions, and a remarkable eagerness to involve others in that process. And its an approach that Ive often felt myself returning to in my own career.
Previn Warren: I was always struck by the particular care with which he reviewed the submissions of pro se litigants. The Judge felt that his role was to be as neutral and fair as possible, which meant doing his best to understand the issueseven if they were presented in a rough and untutored way. When you review hundreds of briefs a year, it is easy to discount the ones that are riddled with spelling errors and presented in confusing prose. Judge Garland resisted that impulse at every turn.
That disciplined commitment made a deep impression on me; since clerking for the Judge I have maintained an active pro bono practice representing indigent prisoners in their civil appeals.
Kendall Turner: My work with Judge Garland made me realize that, no matter how busy one is, it is important to make time to help those less fortunate. I tutored at the same public elementary school as him because I figured that, if he had time to volunteer, so did I. In my current job, I devote a substantial amount of time to pro bono work for the same reason.
Eric Berger: Judge Garland had worked for many years in the Department of Justice. Though he never talked about this, we all knew that he could have made far more money had he remained a partner in a private law firm. But his years in the Justice Department meant a great deal to him, and he spoke often about his experience serving his country there.
After my clerkship, I took a job at the Washington, D.C. office of Jenner & Block. I selected Jenner in large part because of its great commitment to pro bono work, and that decision was certainly influenced by Judge Garlands example. And while at Jenner, I was fortunate to work on a number of pro bono cases involving issues such as the detention of foreign nationals at Guantanamo Bay, lethal injection, and prisoners rights, including a case in which a prisoner suffered from a botched operation.
Kendall Turner: The American people and Senate already know Judge Garland is smart and qualified. I want them to know that he is incredibly kind. Ive had a lot of great bosses in my life, but Judge Garland taught me the most about how to think, how to write, and how to be a good person all the while.
Josh Segal: The Judge takes a deeply respectful approach to disagreementnot just with other judges, but with litigants as well. Particularly after a spirited round of questioning at oral argument, he would ask his clerks whether he had treated counsel kindly, fairly, and respectfully. (Although we wouldnt have hesitated to say no, the answer was always yes.)
Eric Berger: Judge Garland is the epitome of a careful, fair, non-partisan judge. He never decides a case based on the identity of the parties or the politics surrounding a case. Instead, he impartially applies the law to the facts.
He is the fairest, most impartial person I know.

President Obama Issues a Proclamation: It's National Park Week!
April 16-24 is National Parks Week, says President Obama, who Friday issued a special proclamation declaring so. To celebrate, all National Parks this week are free to visit.
National Parks must be established by an act of Congress; there are currently 59 of them in the United States. The first was Yellowstone, which was formally given its status in 1872 by Ulysses S. Grant:
Great Smoky National Park, on the border of North Carolina and Tennessee, above, is the most popular national park.
The Grand Canyon comes in second.
There are probably some National Parks you've never heard of, too. Such as, the Isle Royal National Park in Michigan, which was established in 1940.
Ninety-five percent of Biscayne National Park in Florida is underwater.
A Department of Interior study found that in 2012, US National Parks generated almost $27 billion.
Obama has acted to preserve more public land than any other President  about 265 million acres during his time in office.
He also developed a program to encourage families to visit:
Pinnacles National Park in California was the most recently designated National Park, signed into law by Obama in 2013.
Get out there and explore your parks, America!

Obama Finds Common Cause on Climate Change With Canadas Trudeau
President Barack Obama welcomed Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the White House on Thursday for a state visit as the two leaders sought to join forces to combat climate change.
Trudeau and Obama have both described the warming planet as among the worlds most pressing challenges. On Thursday the U.S. and Canada issued a joint statement agreeing to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas by as much as 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. As part of that effort, the U.S. is beginning regulatory efforts to limit emissions at existing oil and gas infrastructure for the first time.
Theannouncement underscores that the outgoing president and the incoming prime minister are ideologically aligned and eager to address areas of mutual interest.
We have a common outlook on the world, Obama said Thursday in welcoming Trudeau during a sun-drenched ceremony on the South Lawn. We are steadfast allies and the closest of friends.
Obama, 54, sees himself in the younger Trudeau, 44, whose ascent in Canadian politics was built on pledges of hope and change and an inclusive vision of his country, and whose children are roughly the same age as Obamas when he was elected in 2008. Obama noted the leaders shared commitment to universal health care, gay rights, and support for immigrants and refugees.
Its wonderful to see our American friends and partners share and are working on the exact same priorities, Trudeau said at the White House.
Following the welcome ceremony, Trudeau and Obama headed to the Oval Office for a private meeting where they were also expected to discuss more prickly issues, including security-induced traffic jams at the U.S.-Canadian border and Canadas halting participation in the bombing campaign against Islamic State.
Later in the morning, the two leaders planned to hold a joint news conference at the White House. And in the evening, Trudeau will be treated to a state dinner, including a main course ofherb-crusted Colorado lamb splashed with Canadian whiskey. It will be the first state dinner for a Canadian prime minister since 1997.
The centerpiece of the leaders policy discussions will be the new regulations to limit methane emissions. Methane is 84 times as potent as carbon dioxide in warming the atmosphere over 20 years, and the oil and gas sector accounts for about a third of U.S. emissions, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Next month, that agency will begin a formal process to compel energy companies to provide information about the methane emissions produced through oil and gas activities, including production, transmission, processing and storage.
The EPA is already finishing a rule that would require oil and gas companies to upgrade equipment and search out methane leaks at new and modified wells.Thursdays announcement that the federal governmentwill also clamp down on leaks at existing equipment may assuage concerns from environmentalists who say cutting leaks at new wells isnt enough to meet Obamas carbon-cutting pledges.
According to the statement, the EPA will move as expeditiously as possible to complete this process.
If the EPA is unable to complete work on its methane regulation before the end of the Obama presidency, a Republican successor likely would withdraw the rule. Oil and gas companies, whose profits are suffering because of a drop in prices, probably will seek to derail the plan.
The government in Canadas Alberta province is considering stricter methane rules for new equipment, though they likely wont be as prescriptive as U.S. regulations, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Bernard Chen. Environmental regulators in Canada intend to publish an initial phase of proposed methane regulations by early 2017, according to the joint statement.
Obama and Trudeau also are promising to collaborate in managing the Arctic, including taking unspecified concrete steps to protect at least 17 percent of the regions land and 10 percent of its water.
From shipping to oil development, commercial activities in the region should only occur when the highest environmental standards are met, the countries said. According to the joint statement, the U.S. and Canada will work to develop a shared, science-based standard for considering the broad environmental impacts of commercial activities in the region -- reviews that could incorporate climate change considerations.
Trudeau is bringing with him to Washington his fisheries minister, Hunter Tootoo, an aboriginal Canadian who represents the district of Nunavut, a thinly populated and developed northern territory.
As an Inuk, Im keenly aware of the issues in the North, Tootoo said in an interview. Were on the front lines of climate change and were feeling the impacts of it already.
The two leaders also professed their support for halting routine flaring at oil and gas sites by 2030, committed to collaborate on boosting the fuel efficiency of post-2018 model year heavy-duty vehicles and said they would work together to integrate U.S. and Canadian electric grids, allowing more renewable power to be brought online and shared across the border.
Canadas contributions to the fight against Islamic State have caused some heartburn for the Obama administration. Trudeau withdrew Canadas six fighter jets from the coalition bombing the terrorist group in February, while increasing the number of Canadian troops helping to train Iraqi forces fighting the militants.
Trade is another difficult issue for Obama and Trudeau. The Canadian leader remains noncommittal on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade deal between the U.S. and 11 other Asia-Pacific countries, including Canada, that Obama views as a cornerstone of his legacy.
The pact was hammered out in the middle of Canadas election campaign. Under Trudeau, Canada hopes to enact its own free trade agreement with Europe after revising it to avoid fears that corporations would be gain too much power, a concern that has stalled trade negotiations between the U.S. and the European Union.
The two sides also need to decide whether they want to renew an agreement on Canadian softwood lumber imports that expired in October. U.S. industry groups say that the country unfairly subsidizes its lumber production.
White House officials want Canada to drop a World Trade Organization case challenging a U.S. labeling law requiring retailers to note an animals country of origin on red meat packaging. That law was repealed last month after repeated WTO rulings against the U.S.
The two countries appear to be nearing an agreement to share more records on border crossings between law enforcement agencies and cut restrictions on shippers. The latter would probably require legislation in both countries, the White House said.
There may be incentive to resolve border issues now, before the November U.S. presidential election. Republican front-runner Donald Trump has made a central issue of tightening U.S. immigration policies and border security. Trudeaus aides privately acknowledge they worry about advancing their agenda if a Republican takes the Oval Office. Trudeau, however, has said he could work with Trump.
One of the things I demonstrated through my approach to politics is I work across all party lines. I dont pick and choose on ideologies, Trudeau said of Trump. I think I made very, very clear during our own election campaign here what my take was on certain issues that have come up in the U.S. context, but I dont need to re-litigate any of that. Canadians spoke clearly and I look forward to seeing what Americans decide in November.

The US is spending trillions less than expected on health care
The United States is spending trillions  yes, trillions  less on health care than government forecasters expected when Obamacare passed in 2010.
Back then, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated that the United States would spend $23.7 trillion on health care between 2014 and 2019.
But the forecasting agency has regularly and repeatedly revised spending estimates downward over the past six years. In 2015, it estimated that health care would cost the United States $2.6 trillion less over that same five-year period, a new analysis from the Urban Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation shows.
"Its a pretty significant reduction, and really across all types of spending," says John Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute and co-author of the new report.
This isnt to say that the health care law caused health costs to grow slower than expected. The authors of the report make it clear that while the Affordable Care Act may have played some role, it is far from the main contributor.
Rather, the figures show that the Affordable Care Act hasnt exploded the federal budget, as critics charge. Quite the opposite  health costs have risen modestly as the uninsured rate has dropped to the lowest level on record.
One remarkable fact about the lower-than-expected health costs is that they stretch across the entire health care sector. Medicare spending has come in lower than expected:
And so has private insurance:
A bit of this has to do with lower-than-expected health insurance enrollment.
Medicaid, for example, has millions fewer enrollees than CMS initially expected  a product of the Supreme Court making the programs expansion optional in 2011.
But this isnt the case everywhere: Medicare, for example, is expected to have 700,000 additional enrollees in 2019 for $96 billion less. Think about that for a moment: Medicare will be spending less money to cover more people.
This has everything to do with the fact that per-person costs of health care are dropping. Forecasters now expect Medicare to spend $12,527 per person in 2019  significantly less than their estimate of $13,990 in 2010.
The health care law significantly reduced certain Medicare payments. It also created dozens of new programs that pay hospitals based on the quality of care they provide, not just the quantity.
CMS knew all of this when it forecast health spending in 2010. But it didnt know how exactly the changes would play out  whether hospitals, for example, would sign up for the pay-for-value programs or if they would change the trajectory of health spending. Much to health wonks frustrations, some forecasting agencies refused to estimate any savings from these programs. At the time, they were just too unknown.
Now theres at least some evidence that a handful of these programs are working to reduce costs. Hospital readmissions, for example, have fallen sharply since Medicare began penalizing providers for those unnecessary repeat visits.
Budgeteers will likely cheer the slower health cost growth. Less spending on health care means more money for the government to spend on other things like education or infrastructure.
But for individual consumers, slower health spending likely doesnt feel cheaper at all. In fact, it probably feels more expensive: One big way private insurers have held down costs is by asking consumers to pay a larger and larger chunk of their medical bills.
Deductibles and copays have steadily grown over the past decade. Separate research shows that patients use less health care when they have to pay more. Sometimes they cut out unnecessary care  but patients will also skimp on the care they need, too.

For 2015 not to be the hottest year on record, December will have to be impossibly cold
The only way 2015 will not be the warmest year in global recorded history, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is if December is the coldest December in recorded history -- and is more abnormally cold than any month since data was first collected.
The NOAA measures each month against itself. So what's pictured above is how much hotter or colder each January or May or whatever was than the average of all Januarys or Mays in the 20th century. In September, we noted that the summer of 2015 was hotter globally than any summer on record.
Since then, 2015 has only gotten hotter. Here's what the final stage of the graph looks like now.
That's one way of picturing how hot it has been. Another is to color-code each month according to how much hotter or colderthan average they have been since 1880 and let you scroll through. Like so.
In order for 2015 to not replace 2014 as the hottest year ever, December will need to be very, very cold. Very cold. Historically cold. In order for 2015 to simply drop to second, here's what December will need to look like:
Or, to go back to the original version of the chart, like this.
And that's simply to have 2015 be the second-hottest year on record. In order for 2015 to only be second-hottest, December needs to be more cold than any month has ever been -- 16 percent colder than the coldest month (relative to itself) on record: January 1893.
In other words, 2015 will be the hottest year on record.

Americas Companies Keep Pledging To Reduce Emissions
President Obama hosted a roundtable for CEOs from five Fortune 500 companies and five supply chain companies on Monday, as part of the White Houses Act on Climate Initiative, which urges businesses to make carbon-reduction pledges before the upcoming United Nations climate conference.
Leaders from Johnson & Johnson, Intel Corp., Berkshire Hathaway Energy Co., Hershey Co., and PG&E; Corp., as well as five other companies that act as suppliers to those corporations, attended.
This conversation has confirmed what weve known for quite some time, which is that considerations of climate change, energy efficiency, renewable energies are not only not contradictory to their bottom lines, but for these companies, theyre discovering that they can enhance their bottom lines, Obama said in remarks released after the meeting.
Mars, Nike, and Bloomberg are among the companies that announced new carbon-reduction targets. As of Monday, 81 companies had signed on to the Act on Climate pledge, and more are expected, a White House official said.
Todays announcements are a significant milestone, but by no means the end, Senior White House adviser Brian Deese said on a call with reporters Monday. So far, companies represented operate in all 50 states, employ more than 9 million people, and have more than $3 trillion in annual revenue, according to the White House.
The pledges are submitted by the companies and are tailored to their specific business practices. PG&E;, a utility serving 16 million people, will achieve a 60 percent renewable mix by 2020. Nike announced that it would use 100 percent renewable energy in all its owned or operated facilities by 2025, while Nestle has water-reduction goals included in its pledge.
The prevailing message behind all the pledges, though, is that action on climate change is a boon to business.
We believe a focus on business and climate change can go hand in hand, Todd Brady, global environmental director for Intel, said on the call with reporters.
While American businesses might be coming around to that message, it has been more difficult to get Congress on board, despite the fact that Americans overwhelmingly accept the scientific conclusion that climate change is happening.
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) called Congress to task Monday, after the announcement.
While I appreciate these efforts from corporate America for a good outcome in Paris and to reduce their own carbon footprints, in my experience none of this is filtering through to Congress in the form of lobbying or advocacy, he said in a statement. He went on to suggest that advocacy from the business community is going to be critical in changing policy.
The massive American corporate lobbying effort in Congress is at best silent on climate change, and at worst adamantly hostile, Whitehouse said. For that to change, these companies will have to take responsibility for the advocacy efforts of groups that represent them in Congress, and align their advocacy with their policy.
The Obama administration has taken a number of steps to reduce carbon emissions without Congressional action. The Clean Power Plan, finalized this summer, requires states to figure out how they will reduce emissions from the electricity sectorwhich currently accounts for nearly a third of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. The administration has also announced deals with China, Brazil, and India, all major polluters.
But how the international community will develop and enforce climate goals remains to be seen. Negotiators are in Bonn, Germany this week, hashing out final details before the Paris conference in December. Some have speculated that putting a price on carbon might be an option.
Melissa Lavinson, chief sustainability officer at PG&E;, called a price on carbon absolutely something the country needs during a roundtable hosted by Ceres and Huffington Post on Monday.
Ann Kelly, a senior program director at Ceres, suggested putting a price on carbona mechanism that has been successfully deploying in New England, for example, would be the best way forward.
It would be infinitely easier if we could put a price on carbon, she said. You tax the thing you dont want. Its that simple. And all the economists agree.
The head of the International Monetary Fund called for such a system earlier this month.

175 nations sign historic Paris climate deal on Earth Day
World leaders from 175countries signed the historic Paris climate accord Friday, using Earth Day as a backdrop for the ceremonial inking of a long-fought deal that aims to slow the rise of harmful greenhouse gases.
"We are in a race against time."U.N. secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the gathering at the United Nations headquarters in New York. "The era of consumption without consequences is over."
"The poor and most vulnerable must not suffer further from a problem they did not create," Ban added.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry signed the document while holding his young granddaughter. She wasone of 197 children at the event to represent the partiesthat adopted the agreement, Ban said.
"These young people are our future.Our covenant is with them," Ban said. "Today is a day for our children and grandchildren and all generations to come."
The non-binding treaty, approved in Paris in December after years of U.N. climate negotiations, aimsto slow the rise of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, blamed for putting Earth on a dangerous warming path.
The deal sets a target of limiting global warming by 2100 to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees F), as compared to pre-industrial levels. To accomplish that, each nation sets its own target for reducing emissions and updates that mark each year.
Friday's signing sets a record for the number of countries signing an agreement on the first available day, the Associated Press reported.The old record goes back to the Law of the Sea in Montego Bay, which was signed by 119 countries in 1982, according to AccuWeather.
Signingthe accord is only one step in the process. The leaders must now go back to their home countries' governments to ratify and approve the agreement, which could take months or years.The deal goes into effect once 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions formally join.
Nations not at the ceremony will have one year to sign the accord, then will need extra time to get itratified and approved by their governments.
The U.S. and China, which together account for nearly 40% of global emissions,said they intend to formally join the agreement this year, AP reported. Both nationssigned the document Friday.
The signing could not come soon enough," saidAndrew Steer, president of the World Resources Institute. "Each month since the Paris agreement was reached has brought fresh evidence that Mother Nature has a fever and all life on Earth is suffering the consequences."
Last year was the planet's hottest on record, and 2016 is already on path to surpass it, according to data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA.
Over thepast winter, the peak in Arctic sea ice was the lowestsince records began 37 years ago, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.
"The signing and early ratification of the Paris agreement will be essential if we are to save the world from runaway climate change," said Hugh Sealy, a U.N. climate change expert from St. George's University in Grenada.
We wont beat climate change with a piece of paper," said Rhea Suh,president of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Today marks a beginning, a historic start."
"Were leaving the age of Jurassic fuels behind  for good  and moving to cleaner, smarter ways to power our future," she said.
Mike Duncan, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, called the signing "nothing more than a parlor game lacking consequence or purpose; its purely symbolic."
"The simple truth of the matter is that the agreement is an exercise in futility as the reduction targets are wholly unachievable," he added.

Potential Outcomes of the Supreme Courts Biggest Abortion Case in Decades
Any day now, the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on a challenge to dangerous restrictions that have devastated access to safe, legal abortion in Texas. The case, Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, could further devastate on abortion access in the state.
A womans very right to access safe, legal abortion is before the Court. Its ruling could affect access to abortion far beyond Texas, and consequences may reverberate for years to come. In fact, it could redefine abortion access in America. This blog tells you exactly how.
To understand the Courts potential decisions, you have to know that Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt centers on two medically unnecessary restrictions in Texas's omnibus anti-abortion law (known as HB2). Those provisions are two of the most common types of targeted restrictions on abortion providers (TRAP):
Both provisions have nothing to do with making abortion safer theyre designed to force abortion providers to close.
In a blow to abortion access, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled last year that the building and admitting privileges requirements are constitutional even though they severely restrict womens access to safe, legal abortion, and despite the fact that abortion is one of the safest medical procedures in the United States.
The Supreme Court put a hold on the building requirements, but the admitting privileges law is in effect in most of the state. Since Texas's health center shutdown law passed, half of Texas's approximately 40 abortion providers have closed, leaving many women to travel hundreds of miles or cross states lines to get an abortion (if they can get one at all).
Texas paints a grim picture of what could become a reality for people across the country if politicians continue to restrict access to abortion. To protect access to safe, legal abortion, several Texas abortion providers represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights brought the case all the way to the Supreme Court in Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt. And thats the decision were waiting to hear about.
So, what will the Court decide and how will it impact abortion access? Of course, we cant predict what the Court will do, but three potential scenarios seem most likely.
Decision: The Court could rule that both the admitting privileges and building requirements are unconstitutional as an undue burden on womens access to safe, legal health care. And thats victory for Texas women!
Outcomes: Texas's admitting privileges and building requirements would be eliminated, but the decision would not immediately undo TRAP laws in all states.
Decision: The outcome here could be a mixed bag. For example, the Court could uphold one dangerous abortion restriction (like admitting privileges), and strike down another (like the building standards). Or the Court could give a super narrow ruling, or one based on a technicality. Or the Court could just kick the can down the road, postponing a decision altogether.
Consequences: A ruling in the mixed-bag category could be good and bad for women.
Decision: The Court could let Texas's HB2 stand, permitting both extreme TRAP laws to remain in place in Texas.
Consequences: If the Court votes to let Texas HB2 stand, all but nine abortion providers in the whole state of Texas will close.
Ultimately, letting Texas's clinic shutdown law stand will create two Americas  where a womans right to access safe, legal abortion depends on where she lives. Women would be left with a patchwork system of rights because of this decision, along with additional state attacks on abortion.
Within all of these scenarios, theres one thing we know for sure: Any Supreme Court decision will only have immediate impact in Texas. It wont trigger changes for any other state right when it comes down.
In the long run, the decision could lay the groundwork in other states for either challenges to existing restrictions  or even more abortion restrictions. No matter how you look at it, a womans fundamental right to safe, legal abortion is under attack. But we wont go back.

President Obama: The TPP would let America, not China, lead the way on global trade
Over the past six years, Americas businesses have created more than 14million new jobs. To keep this progress going, we need to pursue every avenue of economic growth. Today, some of our greatest economic opportunities abroad are in the Asia-Pacific region, which is on its way to becoming the most populous and lucrative market on the planet. Increasing trade in this area of the world would be a boon to American businesses and American workers, and it would give us a leg up on our economic competitors, including one we hear a lot about on the campaign trail these days: China.
Of course, Chinas greatest economic opportunities also lie in its own neighborhood, which is why China is not wasting any time. As we speak, China is negotiating a trade deal that would carve up some of the fastest-growing markets in the world at our expense, putting American jobs, businesses and goods at risk.
This past week, China and 15 other nations met in Australia with a goal of getting their deal, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, done before the end of this year. That trade deal wont prevent unfair competition among government-subsidized, state-owned enterprises. It wont protect a free and open Internet. Nor will it respect intellectual property rights in a way that ensures Americas creators, artists, filmmakers and entrepreneurs get their due. And it certainly wont enforce high standards for our workers and our environment.
Fortunately, America has a plan of our own that meets each of these goals. As a Pacific power, the United States has pushed to develop a high-standard Trans- Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that puts American workers first and makes sure we write the rules of the road for trade in the 21st century.
This agreement strengthens Americas economy. The TPP brings together 12countries representing nearly 40percent of the global economy to make sure that private firms have a fair shot at competing against state-owned enterprises. It keeps the Internet open and free. It strengthens the intellectual property protections our innovators need to take risks and create. And it levels the playing field by setting the highest enforceable standards and by removing barriers to selling our goods overseas  including the elimination of more than 18,000 taxes that other countries put on products made in America. Simply put, once the TPP is in place, American businesses will export more of what they make. And that means supporting more higher-paying jobs.
This agreement also strengthens Americas national security. When fewer people suffer in poverty, when our trading partners flourish and when we bind our economy closer to others in a strategically important region, America is both stronger and safer.
But none of this will happen if the TPP doesnt become a reality. Thats because the Asia-Pacific region will continue its economic integration, with or without the United States. We can lead that process, or we can sit on the sidelines and watch prosperity pass us by.
If we dont get the TPP done, American goods will continue to face high tariffs and other trade barriers in the region. American businesses will lose competitive access to Asian markets, which would mean fewer of the cars our autoworkers manufacture would make it to growing markets, more of our farmers and ranchers products would run into barriers abroad, and small-business owners hoping to sell their goods abroad would still find themselves ensnared in red tape. If we dont get the TPP done, employers across America will lose the chance to compete with other countries companies on a level playing field. And when American workers and businesses compete on a level playing field, no one can beat us.
I understand the skepticism people have about trade agreements, particularly in communities where the effects of automation and globalization have hit workers and families the hardest. But building walls to isolate ourselves from the global economy would only isolate us from the incredible opportunities it provides. Instead, America should write the rules. America should call the shots. Other countries should play by the rules that America and our partners set, and not the other way around.
Thats what the TPP gives us the power to do. Thats why my administration is working closely with leaders in Congress to secure bipartisan approval for our trade agreement, mindful that the longer we wait, the harder it will be to pass the TPP. The world has changed. The rules are changing with it. The United States, not countries like China, should write them. Lets seize this opportunity, pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership and make sure America isnt holding the bag, but holding the pen.

Survey: Obamacare Customers Satisfied With Coverage
The percentage of Obamacare customers who say they are very satisfied with their health insurance coverage rose after the third open enrollment period, which ended in2016, according to a survey released today by the Commonwealth Fund.
Nearly half of the respondents (44 percent) said they were very satisfied with their plans, while 38 percentreported being satisfied with their 2016 coverage. The Commonwealth Fundsurveyed enrollees between February and April of this year, its fourth survey tracking thehealth laws progress.
While the 44 percent of respondents who said theywere very satisfied was greater than the 40 percent who said so in 2015, 45 percentsaid they were satisfied in 2015,compared to this years 38 percent.
In addition to tracking coverage satisfaction, the survey also tracks the number of people who are uninsured under Obamacare, finding that 12.7 percent of U.S. adults are uninsured. More than half of thepeople whogained coverage under the law, either through Medicaid expansion or the exchanges, were uninsured for more than two years previously,the report says.
The survey findings show that Affordable Care Act coverage is making it easier for millions of Americans to get the health care they need, Sara Collins, the vice president for health care coverage and access at the Commonwealth Fund and lead author of the report, said in a statement. Providing timely access to care is the fundamental purpose of insurance and in this regard the law is working well for most people who are using their plans.

Obama At Lake Tahoe Praises Conservation Efforts
Against the backdrop of the picturesque Lake Tahoe, President Obama said environmental conservation is a key part of fighting the impact of global warming.
Obama spoke on the first of a two-day environmental tour at an annual summit designed to keep the health of Lake Tahoe a priority for the federal government and the states it borders, Nevada and California.
"We embrace conservation because healthy and diverse lands and waters help us build resilience to climate change," the president said. "We do it to free more of our communities and plants and animals and species from wildfires, and droughts, and displacement. We do it because when most of the 4.5 million people who come to Lake Tahoe every year are tourists, economies like this one live or die by the health of our natural resources."
The president then quoted an unnamed former leader of the Washoe Tribe (which has called Lake Tahoe home for thousands of years): "The health of the land and the health of the people are tied together, and what happens to the land also happens to the people."
Lake Tahoe, sometimes called "the Jewel of the Sierra", is 22 miles long and 12 miles wide. It contains so much water that if it were emptied it would cover the entire state of California with one foot of water.
Its stunningly clear, cobalt-blue water is legendary. Mark Twain wrote of the water in his 1872 semi-autobiographical novel, Roughing It.
"Down through the transparency of these great depths, the water was not merely transparent, but dazzlingly, brilliantly so," he wrote.
But development, storm water runoff, pollution, warming water and algae, to name but a handful of factors, have all combined to reduce Tahoe's fabled clarity. In 1968, researchers could see a disk lowered into the water at a depth of 102.4 feet. By 1997, they could see only down to 68 feet.
That was the year President Bill Clinton visited to inaugurate the Lake Tahoe Summit, which annually draws national, state, and local leaders, researchers, and residents together to discuss ways to "Keep Tahoe Blue." The federal government has since spent about $2 billion on the health of the lake and the surrounding environment.
Obama announced that the Department of Interior will spend nearly $30 million on wildfire prevention at Tahoe this year.

In Ongoing Response to Hurricane Sandy, We Must Remain Focused on Climate Change's Long-Term Impacts | Huffington Post
Three years ago today, Hurricane Sandy made landfall on the Northeast, devastating countless homes, businesses, and communities in its path. Over the past three years, and indeed, since President Obama took office, the Administration has invested in hard-hit communities with a single focus: to ensure that affected communities don't just rebuild, but rebuild smarter.
We've seen the alternative. In 2005, days after Hurricane Katrina, officials from the U.S. Department of Transportation gathered in Biloxi, Mississippi to assess damage to the US-90 bridge, where surge and waves had knocked the bridge decks off their foundation like a set of dominoes. Looking just to their right, the officials saw something else: ruins of the previous US-90 bridge, demolished by Hurricane Camille just 36 years prior. The bridge had been rebuilt at the same elevation as the one destroyed in 1969.
That experience, and many more like it, have informed how the Obama Administration prepares for and responds to natural disasters. Recovery can't just be focused on short-term needs, but on long-term risk and vulnerabilities, which continue to rise as a result of climate change. That's why the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force required that all Sandy-related rebuilding projects funded by the Federal Government meet a single uniform flood risk reduction standard informed by the best science and best practices.
To ensure communities are better prepared for the impacts of climate change today and tomorrow, we continue to ensure that we are making decisions based on the latest science and data, we are responding to community-driven priorities, we are doing all that we can to serve vulnerable communities, and we are collaborating with partners to maximize impact.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Federal agencies incorporated the best available science and data, including sea level rise projections and climate resilience, into project planning and design. Building upon the immediate recovery efforts following Hurricane Sandy and to ensure that we are better prepared before disaster strikes, we announced this year the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard. A key deliverable of President Obama's Climate Action Plan and the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Strategy, the national Standard directs agencies to account for the latest scientific projections and adopt stricter siting, design, and construction standards for all Federally-funded projects.
Over the course of the past six years, this Administration also has been steadily creating programs in partnership with the communities they intend to serve. For instance, as a part of the Hurricane Sandy Task Force's Rebuilding Strategy, we brought a wide range of stakeholders--from State and local elected officials to non-profit organizations to science and policy experts and other community organizations--to the table to ensure their efforts were coordinated, that particular attention was paid to already disadvantaged and struggling communities, and that they were helping each other as they helped themselves. Working with these communities, the Administration has removed barriers to investments in resiliency, modernized Federal grant and loan programs to support local efforts, and developed effective, actionable information and tools.
And today, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is releasing a Community Resilience Planning Guide for Buildings and Infrastructure Systems, which provides a practical six-step process for communities to develop long-term resilience goals based on their individual social and economic needs, particular hazard risks, buildings and infrastructure systems, and the community's operations and available resources.
Recognizing that low-income and underserved communities are often less equipped to prepare for and respond to the impacts of climate change, the Obama Administration has made equity a priority. From the Resilience AmeriCorps pilot, which provides much-needed capacity for vulnerable communities to address climate-resilience planning and implementation, to coordinated interagency assistance to high-need communities through smart growth strategies, the Administration is committed to ensuring that communities develop forward-looking strategies and partnerships for building climate resilience.
We also know that we can't do it alone, so we're working hand-in-hand with nonprofit and philanthropic partners to advance shared priorities. In 2013, for example, we created Rebuild by Design to improve the physical, ecological, and economic resilience of coastal areas. The competition has produced regional, cross-disciplinary collaborations between state and local governments, design teams, regional nonprofit organizations, educational institutions, and the public. In the Bronx, for example, the Hunts Point Project will build off recommendations from a Rebuild By Design proposal to invest in resiliency measures around the Hunts Point Food Distribution Center, which serves as the food supply for over 22 million people.
Since Hurricane Sandy made landfall, the national dialogue about recovery and resilience has shifted. The Obama Administration has led the Federal government in integrating resilience into the fabric of how we build, rebuild, plan, and prepare for the impacts of climate change.
However, the stakes continue to grow. The National Climate Assessment shows that the changing climate is creating drastically different conditions across the United States; deeper droughts, deadlier wildfires, and more powerful storms are putting our communities at risk. Current projections estimate that unabated climate change would cost the global economy over four percent of global GDP each year by 2100. With the costs of climate change adding up, the failure to invest in climate solutions and climate preparedness is fiscally unwise.
Through lessons learned from storms like Hurricane Sandy, we can take on the hard choices necessary to make our communities more resilient in the face of these mounting risks. We simply can't afford to rebuild the US-90 bridge in Biloxi at the same elevation time after time. We have an obligation to protect the planet for the next generation, and it starts by ensuring our communities are more resilient to the emerging challenges of climate change.

140 Countries and 84% of Global Energy Sector Emissions: A Big Week for the Global Fight Against
When Pope Francis visited the White House last week, he said that Climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation, a timely and important observation with the Paris climate conference now just two months away. Developments over the last week reflect the Popes inspiring sentiment. Never before has there been so much momentum to tackle the global climate challenge.
Heres whats happened over just the past seven days:
Last Friday, the U.S. and China released a Joint Statement laying out our shared vision for Paris, and committing to new, concrete climate actions, including Chinas plan to launch a national emissions trading system in 2017. More on that below
On Monday, Brazil became the first major developing country to commit to an absolute emissions reduction target by 2030, with its pledge to reduce emissions 37 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. This pledge builds on the U.S.-Brazil joint statement from President Rousseffs trip to D.C. in June and includes an ambitious goal to deploy renewables beyond hydropower.
Over the course of the week, more than sixty countries submitted their plans to the UN, including small and island nations that put forward specific years by which they would achieve greenhouse gas emissions targets. For example, the Maldives committed to reducing its emissions by 10 percent relative to business as usual by 2030, Djibouti committed to reduce its emissions by 40 percent on that same time frame, and Grenada committed to reduce its emissions by 30 percent relative to 2010 levels by 2025.
And yesterday, India submitted its plan, announcing that by 2030, about 40 percent of its electricity will come from renewable sources like solar and wind, compared to about 15 percent today.
As of today, more than 140 countries have submitted their plans, representing 84 percent of emissions from the energy sector. This number includes all of the worlds major emitters, from the U.S. and China to the European Union and India, to South Africa and Mexico.
This progress over the past week reaffirms that all countries can grow their economies and reduce poverty, while simultaneously leaving a cleaner and safer planet for their citizens.
This progress also shows that by developing plans and setting targets, this process builds momentum for concrete climate action. It was just 10 months ago that President Obama and President Xi stood together in Beijing and made an historic announcement setting respective climate targets for their countries. Now 10 months later, the U.S. and China have come together again to demonstrate to the world our commitment to accelerate actions to meet them.

Support global action on climate change
The Paris agreement is building global momentum to tackle climate change, but we can't stop now. Don't let deniers derail progress.
Volunteers join together to lead on climate change
 These organizers know that tackling climate change is going to take more than a conference of world leaders. They know that there's still more work to do, at every level. The summit kicked off with an update from OFA Director of Policy and Campaigns, Jack Shapiro, on the state of the world's climate and the political landscape on this issue in the United States. Afterward, attendees participated in hands-on exercises to learn how to more effectively approach the issue of climate change when speaking to elected officials. Local officials and representatives are just as important as global leaders in the fight to reduce carbon pollution and move toward more sustainable energy resources. That's why it's critical for organizers to be able to effectively communicate their goals and interests, to persuade local stakeholders to do the right thing on climate change. Participants developed individualized strategies through the lens of their own organizations and then got a chance to put it into practice during a simulation with real-time feedback from trainers. At the final National Issue Summit of the year, OFA volunteers, chapter leaders, and organizing fellows joined together with representatives from allied organizations to work on becoming more effective advocates for action to address climate change.Afterward, attendees participated in hands-on exercises to learn how to more effectively approach the issue of climate change when speaking to elected officials.

As the international community gathered in Paris last week to work on a long-term, global agreement to tackle climate change, OFA volunteers from around the country met in Denver, Colorado, to do their part in the fight.At the end of the day, participants shared key phrases from the training that they want to always remember in order to be successful advocates and organizers. Here are some of the most salient highlights:Those are exactly the takeaways the training team was shooting for as they put this summit together. A lot of progress happens at the local level and building strong, sustainable relationships with key stakeholders is key to a successful organizing strategy.As the 2015 training calendar winds down, the OFA training team is gearing up for another big year in 2016 to continue training the next generation of organizers. From webinars and summits, to fellowships and partnerships, OFA is working to empower organizers across the country, giving them the skills and resources to make a greater impact in their communities.These trainings, like this movement, are funded by small-dollar grassroots donations from individuals across country.
Michelle Obama: This issue is personal for me
Michelle Obama is the first lady of the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Watch CNN Films' "We Will Rise: Michelle Obama's Mission to Educate Girls Around the World" on CNNgo.
Neither of my parents and hardly anyone in the neighborhood where I grew up went to college. But thanks to a lot of hard work and plenty of financial aid, I had the opportunity to attend some of the finest universities in this country. That education opened so many doors and gave me the confidence to pursue my ambitions and have a voice in the world.
For me, education was power.
And a few years ago, when I had the honor of meeting Malala Yousafzai , who was shot in the head just for trying to go to school, this issue got really personal for me. I saw that the terrorists who nearly killed her were trying to silence her voice, snuff out her ambitions, and take away her power.
That's why I decided to work on global girls' education as first lady: because right now, there are tens of millions of girls like Malala in every corner of the globe who are not in school -- girls who are so bright, hardworking and hungry to learn. And that's really the mission of the Let Girls Learn initiative we launched last year: It's a global effort to give these girls the education they need to fulfill their potential and lift up their families, communities and countries.
Now, as first lady, I have no budget of my own for programs, and I have no authority to make or pass laws. That's why, when we first launched Let Girls Learn, many folks doubted that we could make a real impact on this global issue.
But over the past year and a half, we've established partnerships with some of the world's largest companies and organizations that are committing money, resources and expertise. We're collaborating with countries like Canada, Mexico and the Nordic countries on girls' education efforts. Countries like Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have collectively pledged nearly $600 million.
The United States is investing over a billion dollars through new and ongoing efforts and running Let Girls Learn programs in more than 50 countries. The World Bank Group will be investing $2.5 billion over the next five years. And through social media campaigns, Let Girls Learn has rallied people across America and across the globe to step up and be champions for girls worldwide.
All this is happening because time and again, whether it's a head of state, a corporate CEO, or a 15-year-old girl here in the United States, when people hear the stories of girls who aren't in school, they want to help.
This powerful film chronicles the lives of some of the girls I visited this past summer in Liberia and Morocco, two countries in Africa where many girls struggle to get an education. I was joined in my travels by the actors and activists Meryl Streep and Freida Pinto , who are also passionate about girls' education, as well as CNN anchor Isha Sesay
Together, we sat down with girls in both countries to discuss the barriers they face and the dreams they hold for their futures. Like so many girls around the world, many of these girls come from families struggling with poverty. Some endure dangerous commutes to and from school each day. Others face cultural pressures to drop out, marry young and start having children of their own.
But these girls have big plans for their lives. They want to attend college and become doctors, teachers, engineers, entrepreneurs; and day after day, they do whatever it takes to get the education they need to fulfill their dreams. They get up before dawn, and spend hours harvesting crops, cooking for their families and tending to their younger siblings before heading to class. After school, they work as maids and in factories, and they study for hours late into the night.
Unlike so many girls around the world, we have a voice. That's why, particularly on this year's International Day of the Girl, I ask that you use yours to help these girls get the education they deserve . They're counting on us, and I have no intention of letting them down. I plan to keep working on their behalf, not just for the rest of my time as first lady, but for the rest of my life. I hope you will join me.
The Paris Climate Deal Is President Obamas Biggest Accomplishment
This weekend, leaders from 196 countries approved the first global agreement to limit greenhouse-gas emissions in human history. The pact is a triumph of international diplomacy shared by diplomats across the planet. It also represents the culmination of a patient strategy by the Obama administration that unfolded over years, and which even many sympathetic journalists long dismissed as fanciful. Obamas climate agenda has lurked quietly on the recesses of the American imagination for most of his presidency. It is also probably the administrations most importantaccomplishment.
1. Climate change is different from other issues. The Obama administration has enacted important reforms to prevent a Great Depression, reform health care, overhaul the financial system and education, and craft important breakthroughs with Iran and Cuba. But climate change occupies a category of its own. The damage from climate change is irreversible. Melted glaciers cannot be easily refrozen; extinct species cannot be reborn; flooded coastal cities are unlikely to be rebuilt. Action to mitigate climate change has an urgency nothing else canmatch.
2. Paris is a BFD. In 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change called for a global treaty to limit the effects of greenhouse-gas emissions. The United Nations spent the next quarter century trying, and failing, to organize effective world action, despite increasingly dire warnings of massive, deadly, irreversible change that would threaten human life as we know it. An extremely simple conclusion can be drawn from this timeline: A worldwide-climate-change agreement is incredibly hard to do. If the Paris agreement were a simple matter of serving some nice French meals and writing some vague feel-good goals, it would have taken less than a quarter-century tohappen.
3. Paris does not exist on its own. The Obama administrations climate strategy began with a massive infusion of $90 billion in green-energy financing in the stimulus, which set off a wave of new investment and research in wind, solar, storage, and other measures. Obama signed the stimulus in his first month in office, and hoped it would launch the passage of a cap-and-trade law and an international climate agreement in Copenhagen. But the strategy derailed badly. The 2009 negotiations in Copenhagen virtually collapsed, and cap and trade was blocked by a coalition of a handful of Democrats from fossil-fuel-producing states and almost the entire RepublicanParty.
At that point, Obamas climate strategy looked well and truly dead. Instead, the administration forged a different path. It used its existing regulatory power under the Clean Air Act to devise innovative new regulations to control greenhouse-gas emissions across the economy. The reductions it could wring from its regulatory powers gave the administration the leverage to negotiate a bilateral agreement with China in 2014. The U.S.-China agreement broke a deadlock between the industrialized West and the developing world that had paralyzed all previous international negotiations. The plunging costs of solar and wind energy, plus new innovations in storage and other clean-energy technologies, made it suddenly plausible for governments across the world to transition their energysystems.
4. Climate action is hard everywhere, but especially so in the United States. Climate change is a devilish issue for any politician, since the costs of action are heavily front-loaded, while the benefits lie far off in the future. Two features of American politics compound the difficulty. The United States has a somewhat unusual form of government in which the legislature and the executive branch can be controlled by opposing parties, which means that the president can negotiate a deal with other world leaders without being able to guarantee his governments support for the result. Any formal treaty requires the approval of two-thirds of the Senate, which is itself an undemocratic body giving disproportionate representation to citizens from small, ruralstates.
Worse still, the United States is the only country in the democratic world that has a major party that questions the scientific theory of anthropogenic global warming. Conservative parties abroad often take more market-oriented, or perhaps less-ambitious, approaches toward limiting carbon emissions. But the stance taken by the Republican Party, in which respected leading figures endorse kook conspiracy theories, is simply not heard anywhere else. And even the Republican leaders who hesitate to openly endorse conspiracy theories utterly dismiss any international action to limit greenhouse-gasemissions.
The interplay of both these dynamics has placed the Obama administration in a singularly difficult position. The U.S. is the worlds largest historic emitter of greenhouse gases, and the leader of the free world. Yet its political system makes the passage of any legally binding international climate treaty utterly inconceivable. The Paris agreement had to work around this obstacle. The result was highly innovative: a collection of pledges from nearly every country that, without formal legal force, nonetheless took on diplomaticweight.
5. Success begets success. Much of the coverage of the Paris agreement has struck a sober note, depicting the agreement as a first step, or cautioning that now comes the hard part. All the caveats are perfectly true. The pledges amount to about half of the reductions necessary to bring emissions down to a level scientists consider safe, as this chart compiled by Brad Plumer shows:
Mitigating climate change is not a simple yes-no proposition. Holding temperature increases to 2.5 or 2.7 degrees Celsius may not be as good as holding them below 2 degrees, but its much better than holding them to 3.3 or 3.8 degrees. Whats more, the structure of the agreement is designed to produce additional reductions over time. At the urging of the U.S., countries are required to reconvene every half-decade and consider tighterreductions.
Obviously, such reductions will only happen if they are economically feasible. But recent history shows that political willpower and innovation feed off each other. Support for green energy in the United States (through the stimulus), Europe, China, and elsewhere spurred research and investment that have triggered a revolution in affordable solar and wind power, among other green-energy technologies. The green-energy revolution has made what was unaffordable in 2009 suddenly affordable. It is realistic to assume that the momentum from Paris will continue the virtuous cycle of political willpower and market innovation  the massive new market for reducing carbon emissions will spur more investment that will produce newer and more efficient technologies, allowing elected officials to make deeper emissionscuts.
It is hard to find any important accomplishment in history that completely solved a problem. The Emancipation Proclamation only temporarily and partially ended slavery; the 13th Amendment was required to abolish it permanently, and even that left many former slaves in a state of terrorized peonage closely resembling their former bondage. The Lend-Lease Act alone did not ensure Great Britain would survive against Nazi Germany; the Normandy invasion did not ensure the liberation of Europe. Victories are hardly ever immediate or complete. The fight continues and history marches on. The climate agreement in Paris should take its place as one of the great triumphs inhistory.
